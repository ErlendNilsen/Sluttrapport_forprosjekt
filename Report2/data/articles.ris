AB  - <jats:p>An epizootic of sarcoptic mange among red foxes<jats:italic>Vulpes vulpes</jats:italic>reached central Norway in 1976, and by 1986 it had spread to the whole country, resulting in a severe decline in the red fox population. We analyse the change in the hunting bags of the predator species red fox and pine marten<jats:italic>Martes martes</jats:italic>, and the prey species capercaillie<jats:italic>Tetrao urogallus</jats:italic>, black grouse<jats:italic>Tetrao tetrix</jats:italic>, mountain hare<jats:italic>Lepus timidus</jats:italic>and willow grouse<jats:italic>Lagopus I. lagopus</jats:italic>from the period prior to and during the mange epizootic. The data are gathered from publications by Statistics Norway and are based on answers from more than 5,000 hunters yearly. On the national level, the hunting bags of capercaillie, black grouse, mountain hare and pine marten were significantly negatively correlated with that of the red fox. When the time series at the national level were detrended, there were positive correlations between the hunting bags of all species without time lag, except that of pine marten, which lagged one year behind the other species. At the local level there were negative correlations between the hunting bag of red fox and those of the small game species except for willow grouse. The study confirms that the red fox is a keystone predator in Scandinavia.</jats:p>

AB  - : Previous studies of the sustainability of wildlife hunting in the Neotropics have not considered the potential dispersal of animals into hunted areas. A literature review of studies of subsistence hunting in the Neotropics suggests that hunting is often conducted in areas adjacent to relatively undisturbed habitat that may act as sources of animals for the hunted sites. We compared studies of tapir (  Tapirus terrestris) hunting at different sites to illustrate the potential bias of sustainability evaluations based on local productivity. The limited information available suggests that dispersal could have a key role in rebuilding animal populations depleted by hunting. Thus, factors that strongly affect dispersal—such as spatial distribution and size of areas with and without hunting, population size in source areas, and social behavior—should be considered when the sustainability of hunting is evaluated in areas with heterogeneous hunting pressure. We suggest the application of two models that use spatial controls (recognizing the potential source-sink nature of some hunted systems and protecting unhunted refugia) to avoid wildlife overexploitation when biological data and enforcement capabilities to regulate harvests are limited. This approach may produce more reliable evaluations of sustainability, provide information on the dynamics of hunting systems, and help local communities and policymakers conserve key areas (including protected areas) that may act as game sources.     Resumen: Las evaluaciones previas de sustentabilidad de la caceria de fauna en el neotropico no han considerado la dispersion potencial de animales hacia las areas de caza. Una revision bibliografica de estudios de caza de subsistencia sugiere que esta se efectua frecuentemente en areas adyacentes a habitats poco perturbados, las que podrian ser fuentes de animales para los sitios con caza. Comparamos estudios sobre caza de tapires (  Tapirus terrestris) en diferentes sitios, para ilustrar el sesgo potencial de las evaluaciones de sustentabilidad basadas en la produccion animal local. La escasa informacion disponible sugiere que la dispersion tiene un papel crucial en la recuperacion de poblaciones de animales con abundancia reducida por la caza. Por lo tanto, se deberian considerar los factores que influyen fuertemente en la dispersion (estructura espacial y tamano de areas con y sin caza, tamano poblacional en areas fuente y comportamiento social) al evaluar la sustentabilidad en areas con presion de caza heterogenea. Se sugiere la aplicacion de dos modelos que usan controles espaciales (reconociendo la dinamica fuente-sumidero en algunos sistemas de caza y protegiendo refugios sin caza) para evitar la sobreexplotacion de fauna cuando hay escasez de informacion biologica y de mecanismos de regulacion de cosecha. Este enfoque produciria evaluaciones de sustentabilidad mas confiables e informacion sobre la dinamica de sistemas de caza y ayudaria a las comunidades locales y a quienes elaboran las politicas a conservar areas clave (incluyendo areas protegidas) que podrian servir de fuentes de fauna.

AB  - Many wildlife species are managed based on the compensatory mortality hypothesis, which predicts that harvest mortality (especially adult male mortality) will trigger density-dependent responses in reproduction, survival, and population growth caused via reduced competition for resources. We tested the compensatory mortality hypothesis on two cougar (Puma concolor) populations in Washington, USA (one heavily hunted and one lightly hunted). We estimated population growth, density, survival, and reproduction to determine the effects of hunting on cougar population demography based on data collected from 2002 to 2007. In the heavily hunted population, the total hunting mortality rate (mean ± SD) was 0.24 ± 0.05 (0.35 ± 0.08 for males, 0.16 ± 0.05 for females). In the lightly hunted population, the total hunting mortality rate was 0.11 ± 0.04 (0.16 ± 0.06 for males, 0.07 ± 0.05 for females). The compensatory mortality hypothesis predicts that higher mortality will result in higher maternity, kitten survival, reproductive success, and lower natural mortality. We found no differences in rates of maternity or natural mortality between study areas, and kitten survival was lower in the heavily hunted population. We rejected the compensatory mortality hypothesis because vital rates did not compensate for hunting mortality. Heavy harvest corresponded with increased immigration, reduced kitten survival, reduced female population growth, and a younger overall age structure. Light harvest corresponded with increased emigration, higher kitten survival, increased female population growth, and an older overall age structure. Managers should not assume the existence of compensatory mortality when developing harvest prescriptions for cougars.

AB  - Willow Ptarmigan in Norway showed the same postures and calls as Red Grouse. Territorial behaviour occurred at dusk and dawn from September to December and from April to June. During the day cocks did not defend territories. This daily rythm was apparently acquired rather than genetic, since captive birds did not show it. Whereas Red Grouse at high density display at all times of day, Willow Ptarmigan seldom do so, regardless of density. Cocks showed higher site tenacity than hens. There was no tendency for young cocks to establish territory close to the territory of their parents.

AB  - A recent increase in the area open to hunters in the Swedish mountains has directed attention to the possibility of overharvesting and greater wildlife disturbance. Using radio-telemetry, the movements of willow grouse Lagopus lagopus in a heavily hunted area were compared to movements in areas where hunting was prohibited. Although hunter density was higher than the regional average, no significant differences in movements, measured as rate or distance, between grouse in hunted and unhunted areas were found. Willow grouse did not move out of the hunted area, a common belief amongst many hunters. Seasonal migration was not induced by deliberate human disturbance. It is suggested that grouse reduce the risk of being killed by habitually moving within a familiar area with known escape sites (cover). Neither hunting, deliberate flushing or catch and release caused a change in the movement patterns of willow grouse. It is suggested that such disturbances were perceived as part of a naturally unpredictable predator environment, and not sufficient to alter grouse movements.

AB  - Using radiotelemetry, we discovered that the Three-wattled Bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), one of Central America's largest frugivorous birds, has the most complex migratory pattern yet recorded for a tropical species. The annual migration cycle included 2- to 5-month stopovers in four distinct life zones: two middle- elevation and two lowland sites separated by as much as 200 km. We captured and radio-tagged bellbirds during 4 years between July and September in middle-elevation forest fragments of the Pacific slope, 6 km from Monteverde in the Tilaran mountain range of north-central Costa Rica. These habitats, which exist almost exclusively as small, isolated fragments on private farms, are poorly represented (<2%) in Costa Rica's system of protected areas. During September and October, the bellbirds migrated from this site to the northeast into the lowland Atlantic forest of southeastern Nicaragua and northeastern Costa Rica. In Costa Rica these habitats have been heavily fragmented. In Nicaragua they remain intact but are highly threatened. In November and December, the bellbirds migrated from these Atlantic forests to heavily modified, little-protected forests along the Pacific coast of southwestern Costa Rica, where they remained until March. Here, most individuals utilized forest remnants and second growth on private property. In March the Bellbirds moved from the coastal areas to middle-elevation (1000-1800 m) moist forest on the Atlantic slope of the Tilaran mountains sites, where they bred. In June and July, they left the breeding area and moved back across the continental divide of the Tilaran Mountains to return to the middle-elevation Pacific slopes where they had been captured. Our findings demonstrate the complicated ecological integration of geographically dispersed tropical ecosystems and the need for comprehensive conservation strategies that include representation of the full array of regional habitats and a greater emphasis on maintaining connectivity. The bellbird's migratory pattern reveals serious inadequacies in protected-area networks of Costa Rica, a country that is considered to have one of the best systems of national parks and reserves in the Neotropics.

AB  - Willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus is considered a popular small game species by many hunters in Scandinavia. A simple harvest strategy would be to prohibit harvest in parts of the total area. We used a spatial model of a fluctuating population of willow ptarmigan, divided into 25 subareas to investigate the possible advantages of buffer zones in managing harvest. We let the breeding success be the source of annual environmental stochasticity but without any spatial variation. Survival was assumed to be density dependent over the total area, whereas dispersal was modelled as density independent. We then compared four major scenarios in which we let dispersal and harvest vary. About 75% of the area could be left open to hunting even if the level of harvest was close to the extinction level if executed in all grids. This harvest strategy would be particularly advantageous if the goal is to provide as many hunting opportunities as possible, rather than to harvest a maximum sustainable yield. Furthermore, it is quite simple and does not need a resource-demanding control system. We believe that a harvest strategy which sets aside a part of the area as a buffer, and places a limit to the harvest effort in the grids that are open for hunting, would be a cost-efficient system with only a small risk of overharvesting.

AB  - <jats:p>Virtual population analysis (cohort analysis) was used to reconstruct past dynamics of a harvested population of martens<jats:italic>Martes americana</jats:italic>in the Bracebridge District of southern Ontario. Harvests in the Bracebridge District were managed using a quota system set by regional authorities. Quotas changed from year to year, apparently on the basis of past trapping success and variation in the proportion of young‐of‐the‐year among harvested animals. The proportion of young in the harvest was a sensitive indicator of the annual rate of increase, whereas trapping success tended to be linked most strongly, in inverse fashion, with marten harvesting quotas. The proportion of martens harvested each year was constant, averaging 34%, despite 3‐fold variation in marten abundance. This proportion was very close to the maximum sustainable yield (36%) for the population, suggesting that the management policy in the administrative unit was effective in the past in sustaining the source population as well as yielding high trapping returns. Monte Carlo simulation showed that proportionate harvesting, such as the policy in the Bracebridge District during 1972–1991, should be considerably less likely to lead to overharvesting than a constant quota policy, particularly at high average yields.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract We analyzed 53 years of banding and band recovery data along with estimates of harvest and population size to assess the role of harvest and density dependence in survival patterns and population dynamics of black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) over the period 1950–2003. The black brant population has declined steadily since complete annual surveys began in 1960, so the role of harvest in the dynamics of this population is of considerable interest. We used Brownie models implemented in Program MARK to analyze banding data. In some models, we incorporated estimated sport harvest to test hypotheses about the role of harvest in survival. We also examined the hypothesis of density-dependent regulation of mortality by incorporating estimates of population size as a covariate into models of survival. For a shorter period (1985–2003), we also assessed hypotheses about the role of subsistence harvest and predation as sources of mortality. The best supported model of variation in survival and band reco...

AB  - Two methods are given for the joint estimation of parameters in models for competing risks in survival analysis. In both cases Cox's proportional hazards regression model is fitted using a data duplication method. In principle either method can be used for any number of different failure types, assuming independent risks. Advantages of the augmented data approach are that it limits over-parametrisation and it runs immediately on existing software. The methods are used to reanalyse data from two well-known published studies, providing new insights.

AB  - The understanding of population dynamics is a central issue for managing large mammals. Modeling has allowed population ecologists to increase their knowledge about complex systems and better predict population responses to diverse perturbations. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) appear sensitive to harvest, but the relative influence of survival and reproductive rates on their population dynamics are not well understood. Using longitudinal data on age- and sex-specific survival and reproduction from a marked mountain goat population in Alberta, Canada, we built a stage-class matrix model to predict short-term numerical changes for 11 other goat populations in Alberta for which the only data available were from annual aerial surveys. Overall, the model provided an acceptable fit to changes in population size for 8 of 12 populations. Temporal trends in population size were underestimated in 2 populations and overestimated in another 2, suggesting that these populations had different vital rates than those of the intensively studied population. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the survival of mature females (aged 5 yr and older) had the greatest elasticity for population growth. Modeled management scenarios indicated that nonselective yearly harvest rates above 1% of goats aged 2 years and older were not sustainable over the short-term for some populations. The simulations also revealed that small (n = 25) and medium-size (n = 50) populations, which correspond to most goat populations in Alberta, had high extinction risk (18 to 82% over 40 years), even in the absence of harvest. Our results confirm that mountain goat populations are very sensitive to harvest, indicate that wildlife managers should prevent female harvest, and suggest that although a high demand for goat hunting exists in Alberta, most populations in this province—and probably small populations elsewhere—cannot withstand exploitation.

We estimated annual and seasonal survival using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Mean male and female annual survival estimates were 0.257 and 0.777, respectively. Annual survival estimates were different between sexes within years, but were homogenous within sexes between years. Survival estimates did not differ among seasons for either sex. However, differences in survival estimates between sexes were detected in the spring, fall and winter seasons. Hunter harvest (46.2% male mortality) and predation (33.3% female mortality) were the leading known causes of mortality for m...

AB  - The present study evaluates dispersal among breeding willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in five closely located subareas in central Norway. During a six-year period, breeding territorial ptarmigan were live-trapped, aged, sexed and genotyped. Since it is believed that female willow ptarmigan are the dispersing sex, and foreign intruders are expected to be more genetically different than birds from the natal subarea, it is predicted that the genetic similarity between breeding birds of a given year (t) and the breeders in the same territories the next year (t 1) would be greater for males than for females. The extent of dispersal is believed to be positively correlated with the intruder pressure. Thus, the genetic similarity outlined above is predicted to be greatest in comparisons where chick production in year l was lowest. Analysis of genetic similarity among territorial birds in two consecutive breeding seasons revealed no significant difference between males and females. However, males showed greater genetic variability between years than females. For both yearling and adult males, the increased variation coincided with changes in the population density. Hence, a significant relationship between genetic similarity and chick production for both yearling and adult males was observed. This may suggest density-dependent dispersal for males, but not for females. The fact that there was a stronger relationship between genetic similarity and natal chick production, than between genetic similarity and mean chick production on all subareas, for both adult sexes, suggests that breeding adults are more often challenged by yearlings from their own subarea than by foreign intruders from neighbouring areas.

AB  - Animal and plant populations often occupy a variety of local areas and may experience different local birth and death rates in different areas. When this occurs, reproductive surpluses from productive source habitats may maintain populations in sink habitats, where local reproductive success fails to keep pace with local mortality. For animals with active habitat selection, an equilibrium with both source and sink habitats occupied can be both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. If the surplus population of the source is large and the per capita deficit in the sink is small, only a small fraction of the total population will occur in areas where local reproduction is sufficient to compensate for local mortality. In this sense, the realized niche may be larger than the fundamental niche. Consequently, the particular species assemblage occupying any local study site may consist of a mixture of source and sink populations and may be as much or more influenced by the type and proximity of other habitats a...

AB  - The effect of researchers on animal behavior and survival has received attention, and avian studies have reported results ranging from few effects to decreases in reproductive success and survival. We examined potential effects of researchers'nest and brood visits on rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) survival and breeding success and the effects of radio transmitters on ptarmigan survival in the central Canadian Arctic in 1988-89. Predation rate of hens (P = 0.92), clutch size (P = 0.28), number of chicks leaving the nest (P = 0.93), and nesting success (P = 0.86) did not differ between disturbed (flushed hen off nest) and undisturbed (determined hen's status on or off nest by telemetric triangulation) nests. Brood size at fledge (P = 0.89) and fledging success (P = 0.14) did not differ between broods that were visited frequently (every 3-4 days) or infrequently (every 6-9 days). Approximately half (n = 27) of the males captured and banded were fitted with radio transmitters. Survival of radio-marked males (S = 0.62) was lower than that of unmarked males (S = 1.00) in 1988 (P = 0.03) and for years pooled (radiomarked, S = 0.55; unmarked, S = 0.83; P = 0.008), but not in 1989 (P = 0.11). Transmitters weighed more in 1988 than 1989 (3.6 vs. 2.3% body mass, respectively). Studies should consider potential effects of researchers and test for them to detect biases that may exist and to develop methods and equipment that have minimal effect on the study animal

AB  - Whether predators can limit their prey has been a topic of scientific debate for decades. Traditionally it was believed that predators take only wounded, sick, old or otherwise low-quality individuals, and thus have little impact on prey populations. However, there is increasing evidence that, at least under certain circumstances, vertebrate predators may indeed limit prey numbers. This potential role of predators as limiting factors of prey populations has created conflicts between predators and human hunters, because the hunters may see predators as competitors for the same resources. A particularly acute conflict has emerged over the past few decades between gamebird hunters and birds of prey in Europe. As a part of a European-wide research project, we reviewed literature on the relationships between birds of prey and gamebirds. We start by analysing available data on the diets of 52 European raptor and owl species. There are some 32 species, mostly specialist predators feeding on small mammals, small passerine birds or insects, which never or very rarely include game animals (e.g. hares, rabbits, gamebirds) in their diet. A second group (20 species) consists of medium-sized and large raptors which prey on game, but for which the proportion in the diet varies temporally and spatially. Only three raptor species can have rather large proportions of gamebirds in their diet, and another seven species may utilise gamebirds locally to a great extent. We point out that the percentage of a given prey species in the diet of an avian predator does not necessarily reflect the impact of that predator on densities of prey populations. Next, we summarise available data on the numerical responses of avian predators to changing gamebird numbers. In half of these studies, no numerical response was found, while in the remainder a response was detected such that either raptor density or breeding success increased with density of gamebirds. Data on the functional responses of raptors were scarce. Most studies of the interaction between raptors and gamebird populations give some estimate of the predation rate (per cent of prey population taken by predator), but less often do they evaluate the subsequent reduction in the pre-harvest population or the potential limiting effect on breeding numbers. The few existing studies indicate that, under certain conditions, raptor predation may limit gamebird populations and reduce gamebird harvests. However, the number and extent of such studies are too modest to draw firm conclusions. Furthermore, their geographical bias to northern Europe, where predator–prey communities are typically simpler than in the south, precludes extrapolation to more diverse southern European ecosystems. There is an urgent need to develop further studies, particularly in southern Europe, to determine the functional and numerical responses of raptors to gamebird populations in species and environments other than those already evaluated in existing studies. Furthermore, additional field experiments are needed in which raptor and possibly also mammalian predator numbers are manipulated on a sufficiently large spatial and temporal scale. Other aspects that have been little studied are the role of predation by the non-breeding part of the raptor population, or floaters, on the breeding success and survival of gamebirds, as well as the effect of intra-guild predation. Finally there is a need for further research on practical methods to reduce raptor predation on gamebirds and thus reduce conflict between raptor conservation and gamebird management.

AB  - Sustainable exploitation of renewable resources depends on the existence of a reproductive surplus, which is determined by the balance between births, deaths, and somatic growth. The reproductive surplus differs spatially and temporally as environmental conditions vary, and even in the absence of exploitation, change is the rule and constancy is the exception. Sustainable yields may be estimated by direct experimentation, observation of natural systems, or deduction from biological understanding. Each of these approaches has limitations, and for large-scale unique resources, the only way to determine the response of the population to harvesting is by direct exploitation. To find the maximum potential yield, the resource must be overexploited at some time, or very similar resources must have been overexploited. Temporal changes in environmental conditions mean that information on sustainability collected in the past may have limited applicability in the future. The unregulated dynamic of exploiters is to push the resources to overexploitation, and even when regulated, exploiters have been very successful at modifying their behavior so that regulations are less effective than anticipated. The most successful institutions at maintaining sustainability have been small-scale community or pri

AB  - SYNOPSIS. As ground nesting homeotherms, alpine and arctic birds must meet similar physiological requirements for breeding as other birds, but must do so in more extreme conditions. Annual spring snowfall and timing of snow melt can vary by up to 1 month and daily temperatures near the ground surface vary from below freezing to over 45 8C in alpine and arctic habitats. Species breeding in these environments have various behavioral, physiological, and morphological adaptations to cope with energetically demanding conditions. We review the ways birds cope with harsh and variable weather, and present data from long term field studies of ptarmigan to examine effects of spring weather on reproduction. In variable but normal spring conditions, timing of breeding was not influenced by snow melt, snow depth or daily temperatures in the alpine, as breeding did not commence until conditions were generally favorable. Arctic ptarmigan tended to vary breeding onset in response to spring conditions. Generally, birds breeding in alpine and arctic habitats suffer a seasonal reproductive disadvantage compared to birds at lower latitudes or elevations because the breeding window is short and in late years, nest failure may be high with little opportunity for renesting. Coping mechanisms may only be effective below a threshold of climactic extremes. Despite strong resilience in fecundity parameters, when snowmelt is extremely delayed breeding success is greatly reduced. Alpine and arctic birds will be further challenged as they attempt to cope with anticipated increases in the frequency and severity of weather events (climate variability), as well as general climate warming.

AB  - Abstract We examined how harvest affected natural mortality rates and how the dynamics of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus, hereafter bobwhite) covey membership might affect the additive nature of harvest. We conducted repeated searches for coveys and radiomarked all coveys found on 12 259-ha study areas in east-central Kansas, USA. We simulated a harvest in 6 randomly selected areas each year during November–January, 1997–2000, by trapping and removing 60% of bobwhites in each covey. We used flush counts and radiotelemetry to measure harvest effects on natural mortality rates, overall winter survival, covey size, and densities. Observed natural mortality rates of radiomarked individuals were similar between harvested (50.6 ± 4.3%) and unharvested areas (52.1 ± 4.7%). Estimated winter survival was 47.9% on the unharvested areas and 20.9% on the harvested areas. Harvest did not affect the number of coveys, average covey size, or density of bobwhites, indicating that coveys coalesced through local mov...

AB  - An intensive seven-year removal of adult, juvenile, and young-of-the-year smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolo- mieu) from a north temperate lake (Little Moose Lake, New York, USA) resulted in an increase in overall population abundance, primarily due to increased abundance of immature individuals. We developed a density-dependent, stage-struc- tured model to examine conditions under which population control through harvest could result in the increase of a tar- geted species. Parameter values were derived from a 54-year data set collected from another north temperate lake (Lake Opeongo, Ontario, Canada) smallmouth bass population. Sensitivity analyses identified the demographic conditions that could lead to increased abundance in response to harvest. An increase in population abundance with harvest was most likely to occur when either (i) per capita recruitment at low levels of spawner abundance was large, juvenile survivorship was high, and maturation of age-4 and older juveniles was moderately high or (ii) per capita recruitment at low levels of spawner abundance was slightly lower, yet the maturation rate of age-3 juveniles and adult survivorship were high. Our modeling results together with empirical evidence further demonstrate the importance of overcompensation as a substantial factor to consider in efforts to regulate population abundance through harvest.

AB  - Overharvesting by humans threatens a substantial fraction of endangered species. Reserves have recently received enormous attention as a means of better conserving harvested resources, despite limited empirical evidence of their efficacy. We used manipulated microcosms to test whether reserves reduce extinction risk in mobile populations of harvested Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliate. Here we show that patterns of population distribution inside and outside reserves can be accurately predicted on the basis of simple models of diffusion coupled with logistic controls on local population growth. No extinctions occurred in eight experimental trials with reserves, whereas extinction occurred in seven of eight trials without reserves, as predicted by population viability models based on stochastic population processes. These results suggest that marine reserves may be an effective means of improving long-term viability in heavily harvested fish species.

(2) I determined the effect of reducing numbers of one sex on the density of the same and opposite sex to test the hypothesis that spacing behaviour limits breeding density of both sexes independently. (3) When removed, territorial females were largely replaced by yearlings, of unknown origin, able to breed. (4) A large reduction in the density of females did not result in a similar reduction in the density of males.

AB  - Abstract The capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) in Central Europe is an endangered species of grouse that is thought to be highly susceptible to human disturbance, possibly causing local populations to decline. We investigated the behavioral response of capercaillie in the Black Forest, Germany, and the French Pyrenees to an off-trail hiker by measuring flushing distances. Flushing distance varied with capercaillie sex, visibility of the hiker, intensity of winter tourism, and hunting pressure. Independent of the study area, males flushed at consistently longer distances than females, and lower visual blocking between bird and hiker resulted in longer flushing distances. Capercaillie flew at longer distances from an approaching hiker in areas with high intensity of winter tourism or hunting pressure than in undisturbed areas. We recommend the establishment of regulations requiring hikers to stay on trails and to close trails where intertrail distances fall below 100 m (90% of all flushing events appeared wit...

AB  - A study of the population dynamics of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus alleni L.) was carried out in southeastern Newfoundland from 1955 through 1965. The adult population in spring increased from 1955 to 1961, then decreased in each of the four remaining years, 1962-65. Clutch size varied independently of population trend, being larger in early nesting seasons than in late nesting seasons. Nesting success, by contrast, and chick survival in the first three weeks of life, varied in a non-random sequence, tending to be greater in the years before the peak than in the years immediately after. Changes in population density were associated with changes in the number of young alive per hen in August. Survival after August was about the same each year for all age groups, roughly 28 per cent per year. These observations were consistent with the idea that there was a self-regulatory population process in which the probability of survival of the chicks varied with the stage of population growth.

AB  - Waterbird hunting is a widespread activity in wetlands throughout Europe and constitutes one of the most significant sources of disturbance during autumn and winter. The biological evidence for effects of hunting disturbance on the behaviour and distribution of migratory and wintering waterbirds and its possible impacts on population dynamics is reviewed. Most of the literature has been concerned with local effects of disturbance, focussing on quarry geese and dabbling ducks. Comparatively little is known about effects on diving ducks and waders, while there is no direct evidence for impacts at the population level for any waterbird species. Hunting disturbance can cause temporary disruption of normal activities of waterbirds, alter their diurnal rhythms and increase escape flight distances. It can displace waterbirds from preferred feeding and roosting habitats at local or regional level and increase turnover, so that the carrying capacity of a site is not reached. Quarry waterbirds, and those occurring in large inshore concentrations, such as many dabbling ducks, geese and waders, are potentially most sensitive to disturbance. Hunting disturbance can disrupt pair-bonds and family structures which may affect reproductive output. Evidence is provided that many waterbird populations are limited by winter conditions and that the majority of studied waterbird species lose body reserves during winter. Because hunting disturbance causes under-exploitation of potential feeding grounds where population limitation is considered to occur, such disturbance will, by definition, have an impact at the population level. However, the magnitude of this impact has not been quantified and requires a modelling approach.

AB  - Hunting can have potentially significant impacts on wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations. We developed a 2-sex Leslie-type matrix model that predicts wild turkey population size for spring-summer and fall-winter periods to understand the effects of hunting on the dynamics of wild turkey populations in Virginia and West Virginia. A base model incorporates parameters derived from a large-scale radiotelemetry study (n = 1,543 hens radio-tagged) conducted over areas with different fall hunting seasons in Virginia and West Virginia from 1989 to 1994. These data made it possible to evaluate the effects of season length, season timing, and 1- versus 2-sex kills on population growth and future harvests. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that fall hunting has the strongest negative effect on the population growth rate. For the range of parameters explored, population growth rate appeared to decrease linearly with increases in fall hunting. Also, the proportion of males in the population was more sensitive to fall rather than spring hunting. These results were invariant to a wide variety of different model calibrations.

AB  - Abstract Estimating cause-specific mortality is often of central importance for understanding the dynamics of wildlife populations. Despite such importance, methodology for estimating and analyzing cause-specific mortality has received little attention in wildlife ecology during the past 20 years. The issue of analyzing cause-specific, mutually exclusive events in time is not unique to wildlife. In fact, this general problem has received substantial attention in human biomedical applications within the context of biostatistical survival analysis. Here, we consider cause-specific mortality from a modern biostatistical perspective. This requires carefully defining what we mean by cause-specific mortality and then providing an appropriate hazard-based representation as a competing risks problem. This leads to the general solution of cause-specific mortality as the cumulative incidence function (CIF). We describe the appropriate generalization of the fully nonparametric staggered-entry Kaplan–Meier survival e...

AB  - Selective harvesting regimes are often implemented because age and sex classes contribute differently to population dynamics and hunters show preferences associated with body size and trophy value. We reviewed the literature on how such cropping regimes affect the demography of the remaining population (here termed demographic side effects). First, we examined the implications of removing a large proportion of a specific age or sex class. Such harvesting strategies often bias the population sex ratio toward females and reduce the mean age of males, which may consequently delay birth dates, reduce birth synchrony, delay body mass development, and alter offspring sex ratios. Second, we reviewed the side effects associated with the selective removal of relatively few specific individuals, often large trophy males. Such selective harvesting can destabilize social structures and the dominance hierarchy and may cause loss of social knowledge, sexually selected infanticide, habitat changes among reproductive females, and changes in offspring sex ratio. A common feature of many of the reported mechanisms is that they ultimately depress recruitment and in some extreme cases even cause total reproductive collapse. These effects could act additively and destabilize the dynamics of populations, thus having a stronger effect on population growth rate than first anticipated. Although more experimental than observational studies reported demographic side effects, we argue that this may reflect the quite subtle mechanisms involved, which are unlikely to be detected in observational studies without rigorous monitoring regimes. We call for more detailed studies of hunted populations with marked individuals that address how the expression of these effects varies across mating systems, habitats, and with population density. Theoretical models investigating how strongly these effects influence population growth rates are also required.

AB  - Few studies have examined the effect of interactions between predation and hunting on the rate of game bird mortality throughout the year. We monitored 134 radiotagged willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus lagopus) on 3 contiguous areas. 2 nonhunted and 1 hunted, in central Sweden between 1992 and 1995. We recorded 100 known mortalities: 22 from hunting, 40 from raptors, 19 from mammalian predators, and 19 from other causes. Excluding hunting, cause of death was similar on hunted and nonhunted areas (P > 0.5), with raptors the most important cause of death in all seasons. We did not record any deaths due to mammalian predators in winter or spring, and deaths through collision with power lines only affected winter, but not annual, survival rates. Cox proportional hazard modeling revealed season (autumn. winter-spring, summer) and area (hunted, nonhunted) as the only variables to affect risk of death (P 0.78) through the summer period. We believe hunting mortality was mostly, if not totally, additive to natural mortality in our study. The population density on the hunted area did not decline as expected from the results, and we suggest that immigration from beyond the neighboring nonhunted areas was sustaining the population. We conclude that a harvest model for willow grouse must take account of dispersal and predation rates at a landscape scale.

AB  - Summary     1. We assessed the impact of predation by hen harriers and peregrine falcons on a red grouse population in southern Scotland during 1992–98. Grouse density in April, July and October declined during this time, coincident with an increase in the numbers of breeding harriers and peregrines.     2. Winter losses of grouse between October and April averaged 33% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of about 70% of winter mortality and they killed about 30% of the grouse present in October. We were unable to determine whether winter mortality in raptors was additive to other losses.     3. Summer losses of adult grouse between April and July averaged 30% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of more than 90% of the early summer mortality of adult grouse. Summer losses of grouse chicks between May and July averaged 45% and were not density-dependent. Harriers killed about 28% of grouse chicks by late July and about 37% by the end of August. Summer raptor predation on adult grouse and chicks appeared to be largely additive to other losses and we estimated that it reduced autumn grouse densities by about 50%.     4. A model combining the estimated reduction in autumn grouse density caused by raptors with the observed density dependence in winter loss predicted that, in the absence of raptors for 2 years, grouse density in spring would be 1·9 times greater, and grouse density in autumn 3·9 times greater, than in the presence of raptors. The model suggested that raptor predation prevented the grouse population from increasing and was thus a limiting factor.

AB  - The effects of necklace radio transmitters on survival and breeding success of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus in southern and central Scotland during 1991-1994 were assessed. Recovery rates of birds with 15-g dummy radio transmitters did not differ from those of control birds marked with wing tags only. Clutch size and hatching success did not differ between female grouse equipped with functioning radio transmitters and an independent sample of control birds. It appears that necklace radio transmitters had no measurable effect on survival and breeding success of red grouse in our study areas, although the power of the statistical tests was low.

AB  - Theory predicts that small populations may be driven to extinction by random fluctuations in demography and loss of genetic diversity through drift. However, population size is a poor predictor of extinction in large carnivores inhabiting protected areas. Conflict with people on reserve borders is the major cause of mortality in such populations, so that border areas represent population sinks. The species most likely to disappear from small reserves are those that range widely-and are therefore most exposed to threats on reserve borders-irrespective of population size. Conservation efforts that combat only stochastic processes are therefore unlikely to avert extinction.

AB  - Mean territory size decreased gradually from 7.5 ha in 1979 to 4.3 ha in 1982 and increased sharply to 7.8 ha in 1983. During the same period, mean territory size was inversely proportional to breeding density in the current spring, and to chick production in the preceding summer. It is suggested that the fluctuation in mean territory size was predominantly affected by changes in the intruder pressure caused by young cocks, but was also associated with a change in the aggressive state of territorial cocks. Mean territory size of young and old cocks did not differ significantly. Mated cocks had significantly larger territories, weighed significantly more, and survived better than unmated cocks. Some indirect evidence for the existence of a surplus population was found.

AB  - Recently, Roseberry (1979) attempted to (1) clarify the theoretical basis for harvesting bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), (2) assess the impact of varying intensities of harvest on standing densities and long-term yields, and (3) define a harvest strategy appropriate for the bobwhite resource in Illinois. That paper, based on 24 years of field data, unfortunately contains 2 methodological or conceptual errors that are fundamental to the 3 objectives. Both errors are subtle, and as others have made the same or similar errors in analysis, we identify the problems in a way we hope will be taken constructively.

AB  - Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) show unstable population dynamics. The number shot for sport at Rickarton moor in northeast Scotland, for example, has cycled with 10-11-yr periodicity since 1946. Here, demographic and other causes of a population cycle were documented from 1979-1989, and an experiment tested the prediction that removing some cocks during the increase phase would prevent a subsequent cyclic decline. Throughout the study, sport shooting was stopped on the area where the main work was done. During 1979-1982, before the experimental removal of cocks began, numbers over the whole moor rose from a trough at the start of the study. On the control area, the cyclic peak in 1983 was followed by a decline until 1988, as predicted in advance from models derived from a previous study elsewhere. On the experimental area, enough territorial cocks were removed each spring from 1982 to 1986 to prevent the population from attaining peak densities for five successive years, and no cyclic decline occurred. The removal of cocks resulted in similar numbers of hens being lost from the breeding population. The main demographic cause of population change on control (cycling) and experimental (cycle broken) areas was variation in the recruitment of young cocks to the spring population. On the control area, recruitment was related to cycle phase and breeding success. Changes in food, nitrogen metabolism, and parasite burdens could not explain the cycle. Demographic patterns were consistent with a model in which changes in age structure affected recruitment. These and previous results refute four hypotheses as necessary causes of population cycles in Red Grouse: (1) maternal nutrition, (2) a version of Chitty's genetic hypothesis, (3) host- parasite (caecal threadworm), and (4) predator-prey relationships. The hypothesis that age structure changes and associated behavior cause cycles by affecting recruitment and, thus, population change, remains unrefuted.

AB  - The relative influences of density-dependent and -independent processes on vital rates and population dynamics have been debated in ecology for over half a century, yet it is only recently that both processes have been shown to operate within the same population. However, generalizations on the role of each process across species are rare. Using a process-orientated generalized linear modelling approach we show that variations in fecundity rates in populations of three species of ungulates with contrasting life histories are associated with density and winter weather in a remarkably similar manner. However, there are differences and we speculate that they are a result of differences in size between the species. Much previous research exploring the association between vital rates, population dynamics and density-dependent and -independent processes has used pattern-orientated approaches to decompose time-series into contributions from density-dependent and -independent processes. Results from these analyses are sometimes used to infer associations between vital rates, density and climatic variables. We compare results from pattern-orientated analyses of time-series with process-orientated analyses and report that the two approaches give different results. The approach of analysing relationships between vital rates, density and climatic variables may detect important processes influencing population dynamics that time-series methodologies may overlook.

AB  - A Gyr Falcon Falco rusticolus population in Northern Sweden (66°N, 17°E) was monitored from 1996 to 2002 in relation to its predator–prey interactions with its main and alternative prey species. Ptarmigan species Lagopus spp., and especially Rock Ptarmigan L. mutus, were the Gyr Falcons’ most important prey and constituted more than 90% of the prey biomass. A 21-fold difference in ptarmigan abundance was found across Falcon breeding territories. However, this great variation in prey availability corresponded to only about a 10% shift in Gyr Falcon diet across territories, suggesting that the Falcons were reluctant or unable to compensate for declining ptarmigan availability by using alternative prey categories. Gyr Falcons did not respond functionally to microtine rodent abundance. Their diets were unaffected by a peak in the microtine rodent population cycle when Norwegian Lemmings Lemmus lemmus occurred in high numbers in the study area. Gyr Falcons responded numerically to their prey in two ways. First, there was a reproductive response with a significant relationship between the number of chicks fledged and the number of ptarmigan in the breeding territories. Secondly, although the Gyr Falcons did not utilize microtines as prey, there was a relationship between the microtine rodent abundance and the number of pairs that attempted to breed each year. This could be a result of an indirect community interaction, assuming that other predators switched from ptarmigan to microtines as prey, which could have had a positive effect on the breeding performance of the Gyr Falcons. The Gyr Falcons acted as true specialist predators, and their narrow food niche probably reflected a general lack of suitable alternative prey in the study area.

AB  - Summary     1. Global positioning systems (GPS) were used to track hunters in an area of central Norway where willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus were contemporaneously radio-tracked. A geographical information system (GIS) was then used to study spatiotemporal interactions between hunters and game.     2. Recording hunting activity with the GPS produced accurate and unbiased information about the behaviour and effort of hunters. When GPS tracking nine hunters during 50 hunter-days, data were lost for an estimated time of 30 h 45 min, which constituted about 10% of the total hunting time.     3. Willow ptarmigan hunters walked on average 16·2 km daily at a speed of 2·8 km h–1, and they hunted for 9 h each day, of which almost 6 h was active hunting time. During 50 hunter-days they had 295 h of active hunting, covered a distance of 818 km and harvested 20% of the willow ptarmigan population in the area.     4. The spatial distribution of hunting pressure was strongly dependent on the starting point of the hunters, and areas close to the base cabin were subject to most hunting activity. Areas furthest away, towards the border of the hunting area, experienced little hunting activity.     5. Logistic regression showed that survival probability of ptarmigan was best predicted by distance from the cabin. Shot radio-tagged birds lived closer to the cabin, and had twice as high hunting pressure in their home range, compared with surviving radio-tagged birds.     6. This method of obtaining quantitative data about human effort will have application in other studies when there is a need to quantify and analyse human effort on temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - 1. Mathematical models are frequently used to make predictions of the response of a population to management interventions or environmental perturbations, but it is rarely possible to make controlled or replicated tests of the accuracy of these predictions. 2. We report results from replicated laboratory experiments on populations of a soil mite, Sancassania berlesei, living in 'constant' or 'variable' environments. We experimentally perturbed vital rates, via selective harvesting, and examined the population-level responses. The response depends on the stage manipulated and whether there is environmental variability. Increased mortality usually decreased population size and increased population variability. However, egg mortality in a variable environment increased total population size. 3. We used time-series analysis to construct a stage-based population model of this system, incorporating the responses to both density and variation in food supply. 4. The time-series model qualitatively captures the population dynamics, but does not predict well the way the populations will respond to the change in mortality. Elasticity analysis, conducted on the model's output, therefore did not lead to accurate predictions. 5. The presence of indirect positive population effects of a negative perturbation, but only in a variable environment, suggests that predicting the population response will require the incorporation of density dependence and environmental stochasticity. That the considerable biological complexity of our time-series model did not allow accurate predictions suggests that accurate prediction requires modelling processes within a stage class rather than trying to make do with simple functions of total density.

AB  - Efforts to understand fluctuations in northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance illustrate inadequate knowledge of demographic processes. Therefore, we estimated seasonal survival, annual survival, and cause-specific mortality of 1,001 radio-marked bobwhite in northern Missouri. Annual survival was 5.3 ± O.5% and did not differ between ages (P = 0.33) or sexes (P = 0.48). Fall-spring survival (15.9 ± 0.8%) was less than spring-fall survival (33.2 ± 2.7%, P < 0.001). Females had lower fall-spring survival (13.7 ± 1.1%) than males (17.6 ± 1.1%, P = 0.02). Male-biased sex ratios likely result from differential fall and winter survival. Avian (28.7%) and mammalian (25.7%) predators were primary natural mortality agents. Hunter-retrieved (22.9%) and -unretrieved (5.3%) kill resulted in 28.2% harvest-related mortality. During springfall, males experienced higher avian mortality (26.5%) than females (20.0%) (P = 0.09). Greater vulnerability of males to avian predators may represent a cost of displaying. Each incubation and brood-rearing attempt reduced survival by 16% when compared with nonreproductively active birds during a similar period. Bobwhites must be highly productive to replace annual population losses

AB  - Ring-recovery methodology has been widely used to estimate survival rates in multi-year ringing studies of wildlife and fish populations (Youngs & Robson, 1975; Brownie et al. , 1985). The Brownie et al. (1985) methodology is often used but its formulation does not account for the fact that rings may be returned in two ways. Sometimes hunters are solicited by a wildlife management officer or scientist and asked if they shot any ringed birds. Alternatively, a hunter may voluntarily report the ring to the Bird Banding Laboratory (US Fish and Wildlife Service, Laurel, MD, USA) as is requested on the ring. Because the Brownie et al. (1985) models only consider reported rings, Conroy (1985) and Conroy et al. (1989) generalized their models to permit solicited rings. Pollock et al. (1991) considered a very similar model for fish tagging models which might be combined with angler surveys. Pollock et al. (1994) showed how to apply their generalized formulation, with some modification to allow for crippling losses...

AB  - A previous study of survival in territorial and non-territorial red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus conducted between 1957 and 1967 found that territorial status in the autumn pre-determined over-winter survival. A very high proportion of territorial birds survived and virtually all non-territorial birds died or emigrated. We tested the hypothesis that over-winter survival was dependent on territorial status within four grouse populations in Scotland between 1986 and 1993. In contrast to the previous study, 66% of non-territorial birds survived over winter compared to approximately 70% of territorial birds. There was no significant effect of territorial status on the survival estimates. Moreover, some of the birds considered to be non-territorial during autumn went on to successfully raise a brood. We suggest that on our study sites, territory ownership in autumn did not greatly influence over-winter survival, and territorial behaviour did not determine breeding density as previously supposed. We postulate differences with other studies may reflect variations in scale and predation pressure.

AB  - Hunting is one of the human activities that directly affect wildlife and has received increasing attention given its socioeconomic dimensions. Most studies have been conducted on coastal and wetland areas and showed that hunting activity can greatly affect bird behaviour and distribution. Hunting-free reserves for game species are zones where birds find an area of reduced disturbance. We evaluated the effect of hunting activities on the behaviour and use of hunting-free areas of lapwings Vanellus vanellus, golden plovers Pluvialis apricaria and little bustards Tetrax tetrax in agricultural areas. We compared the habitat use and behaviour of birds on days before, during and after hunting took place. All three studied species showed strong behavioural responses to hunting activities. Hunting activity increased flight probability and time spent vigilant (higher on hunting days than just before and after a hunting day), to the detriment of resting. We also found distributional (use of hunting-free reserve) responses to hunting activities, with hunting-free reserves being used more frequently during hunting days. Thus, reserves can mitigate the disturbance caused by hunting activities, benefiting threatened species in agricultural areas. Increasing the size or number of hunting-free areas might be an important management and conservation tool to reduce the impacts of hunting activities.

AB  - To estimate the rate, composition, and timing of harvest, we banded 835 ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) on the Navarino Wildlife Area (NWA), Wisconsin, in 1978-81 with reward bands inscribed with our address. Recovery rates were 18, 31, 31, and 20% during 1978-81, respectively, for grouse banded -510 weeks before the hunting season. These rates were adjusted for preseason mortality in the banded sample (26%), crippling loss (13%), nonreported bands (4%), and band loss (1%) to calculate harvest rates of 29, 50, 50, and 32% during 1978-81. Mean band recovery rate (25%) and mean estimated harvest rate (40%) were higher than reported elsewhere, except for a recent study in central Wisconsin. About 23% of the bands were recovered in December, indicating that late-season hunting was relatively heavy. Band recovery rates were not directly related to age, sex, color phase, or weight of grouse. Movements of juveniles were extensive in fall, and recoveries were distributed widely on NWA. A relatively small proportion of hunters recovered a high proportion of the bands. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 50(3):361-367 One of the 1st investigations into the effects of hunting on ruffed grouse was conducted in New York by Bump et al. (1947). Additional studies have taken place in different parts of the ruffed grouse range, including Michigan (Palmer 1956, Palmer and Bennett 1963), Wisconsin (Dorney and Kabat 1960), Minnesota (Gullion and Marshall 1968), and Alberta (Rusch and Keith 1971, Fischer and Keith 1974). These authors generally concluded that sport hunting did not adversely affect local populations of ruffed grouse. However, these studies were conducted on large areas with contiguous habitat, relatively short hunting seasons, and moderate hunting pressure. Relatively little was known of the movements of ruffed grouse and the extent of spring and fall dispersal. This information is important when comparing differences in population levels before and after a hunting season because ingress or egress could bias results. Public hunting grounds have tended to concentrate increasing numbers of hunters, especially when these areas are close to large centers of population (DeStefano and Rusch 1982). Hunting season lengths in Wisconsin, and to varying extents in other states and provinces, have been liberalized steadily since the late 1920's so that much of the state now has a 4-month season that extends to the end of January (DeStefano and Rusch 1982). The effect of changes in hunting pressure and regulations on harvest could be important to the management of local populations of ruffed grouse, especially in areas where efforts are being made to increase population densities through intensive management. Our objectives were to estimate or examine: (1) harvest rates of ruffed grouse on a heavily used public hunting ground, (2) composition of the harvest (sex, age, etc.), and (3) timing of harvest throughout the season.

AB  - Hunting disturbance may affect individuals in a population by modifying their behaviour and spatial movements, which can lead to changes in home-range size and habitat use or displacement, for example into refuge areas. To evaluate effects of disturbance by recreational hunting activity, we conducted a study with 87 individually radio-marked willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, in experimentally hunted and non-hunted units in central Norway during a four-year period. Contrary to a common belief among many hunters, i.e. that willow ptarmigan abandon a hunting unit in response to hunting activity, none of the birds left hunted units during the first two weeks of the hunting season in our study. Neither, did hunting affect the size of areas used by the ptarmigan or the distance between locations on consecutive days. In fact, day-to-day movements tended to be longer in non-hunted units than in hunted units. Willow ptarmigan responded to the risk of being shot by increasing their use of habitat with dense forest/scrub cover, which provided secure escape sites where birds were more difficult to locate and to shoot by hunters using pointing dogs. The increased use of cover with secure escape sites found for willow ptarmigan indicates that the catch per unit effort of hunters will vary not only with population density, but also with the amount and distribution of dense forest/shrub habitat in hunted units. Where the site-specific catch per unit effort of hunters is difficult to predict, we recommend a management scheme of harvests based on allowing a predefined number of hunters to hunt for the whole season and a seasonal bag limit per hunter.

AB  - Scavenging is often neglected as a source of bias when determining causes of mortality and collecting mortality-related habitat information. The use of mortality-sensing radiotransmitters has greatly increased our understanding of animal survival. However, the potential of lag-time in recovery of carcasses and subsequent determinations of cause of death are seldom addressed. Motion created by feeding predators and scavengers can delay pulse switchover and prolong recovery. We determined the influence of temperature, forest stand type, overhead cover, and carcass condition on scavenging rates, displacement patterns, and habitat sampling biases at perceived kill sites for ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus). We documented carcass disturbance, scavenger species, and displacement distances for 64 carcasses. Mammalian scavengers disturbed 42 of 64 grouse carcasses. Scavenger species identified included mice (Peromyscus spp.), flying squirrel (Glaucomys spp.), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frentata), bobcat (Lynx rufus), eastern coyote (Canis latrans), and common raven (Corvus corax). Air temperature and carcass condition were the dominant factors associated with scavenger disturbance of grouse carcasses. Mammal scavenging activity increased during warmer temperatures, and mock avian kills were scavenged more frequently than whole carcasses. Potential overestimation of mammalian-caused mortality may result from scavenging, especially when ambient air temperature is warmer and carcasses have been previously fed upon.

AB  - We have evaluated to what extent biotic (predation) and abiotic (weather) factors influence annual chick production in willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus lagopus). An index of predation was derived from data on microtine density; weather conditions from daily records of temperature and precipitation. Stepwise regression analysis between observed chick production on two Scandinavian study sites (Tran0y and Lovhogen) for periods of 23 and 19 yr, and independent variables characterizing predation and weather conditions suggested which variables were the most important in determining chick production. The resulting model explains between 56% and 25% of the annual variation in chick production; the calculated values deviating on average between 1.14 and 0.95 chicks/2 adults from the observed ones. Predation was found to be the dominant factor, accounting for 41% and 25% of the annual variation in chick production in the two areas. We suggest that year-to-year variation in reproductive success is, in general, influenced to a greater degree by biotic than by abiotic factors, possibly because the predators "co-adapt" to the ptarmigan.

AB  - A basic assumption of band-recovery analysis is that recovered samples are representative of the banded population. This assumption may be violated if individuals in poor body condition are disproportionately vulnerable to hunting. Thus, we used body mass and band-recovery data from 1,412 mallards (Arras platyrhynchos) trapped at Lake St. Clair, Ontario, during August-September of 1989 and 1990 to test the hypothesis that individuals in relatively poor condition before the hunting season subsequently are at a disproportionately high risk of being shot. Supporting this hypothesis, binary regression analysis revealed negative relationships (P ≤ 0.05) between preseason condition (body mass corrected for structural size) and direct recovery probability in 3 of 8 separate analyses (by year, sex, and age), and overall

AB  - Using a compartmental life history model we comapred clutch sizes and patterns of attrition in fecundity from egg to reproductively mature offspring for both first nests and replacement clutches in two populations of Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) at La Perouse Bay (LPB) and Chilkat Pass (CP) in northern Canada. From her initial clutch of 10.8 eggs, a female at LPB fledged on average 2.9 offspring, a reproductive efficiency of 27%. Of hens losing first clutches, 83% renested and these subsequent clutches contributed 23% to annual fecundity. A female at CP laid an average of 8.1 eggs in the first clutch and fledged 3.0 (37%) offspring. About 67% of females renested if they lost first nests, and renests contributed 14% to net annual fecundity at CP. Over 4 yr at LPB, clutch size, patterns of attrition in fecundity, and return rates of females did not vary, but at CP all measures of fecundity, total nest failure, and female return varied dramatically over 7 yr. Despite the larger clutch size of LPB hens, the overall mean values of net annual fecundity and the rate of return (a measure of survival) of females between years did not differ between the two popualtions. However, patterns of attrition in fecundity differed greatly between sites. Differences in clutch size and renesting ability between LPB and CP may be caused by differences in resource availability or differences in predictability of clutch predation. Clutch size and renesting rate may be higher at LPB to cope with high and predictable egg loss. Clutch loss at CP was variable and unpredictable, and the lower clutch size and renesting rate there may have developed because of lower food availability. We suggest ways to test these hypotheses.

AB  - The understanding of the demographic and ecological mechanisms of population regulation is central in applied ecology, in particular when it comes to managing harvested populations. We document the density dependence of the reproductive success in French grey partridge Perdix perdix populations. We used long-term data collected by the national network monitoring populations with a mere surveillance objective. We investigated a time series spanning 7–14 years for 85 replicate populations by a combined procedure of a regression of reproductive success against density for each population and a metaanalysis of the 85 regression slopes. We avoided two common statistical pitfalls by taking the autocorrelation in time series data into account and by using independent estimates of reproductive success and spring density. The relationship is statistically significant for 10% of the populations, and the meta-analysis of the 85 replicates displays a highly significant pattern (82.3% of the regression slopes being negative). Thus our results both support the existence of a density dependent reproductive success in the grey partridge and moderate the ubiquity of the phenomenon, despite a general trend. We tested whether density dependence occurred through competition or habitat heterogeneity by examining the relationship between the variability of per capita reproductive success and pair density. Our results support both alternative hypotheses depending upon the area of concern. In terms of population and habitat management our findings have implications for hunting interests. The best strategy to maximise the hunting quota when reproductive success is depressed with increased density recommends intermediate values of both pair density and reproductive success, which conciliates hunting interests and conservation objectives. To alleviate density dependence, habitat management should supply limited resources that are homogeneously distributed in space when density dependence operates through competition, and should improve habitat quality of the poorest patches when density dependence operates through habitat heterogeneity.

AB  - Ptarmigan are monogamous, territorial game birds of arctic and alpine tundras. They are gregarious and migratory or nomadic from late summer until spring. Sex-segregation occurs in winter. Populations of rock (Lagopus mutus) and willow ptarmigan (L. lagopus) fluctuate widely from year to year; whether the fluctuations are rhythmic is not known. Breeding densities commonly range from 1 to 10 pairs per square mile. Ptarmigan habitat is unusually free from human disturbance. Most ptarmigan harvested in North America now are killed primarily for food; the main harvest occurs in winter. Sport hunting exists on a small fraction of ptarmigan range. The only active management of ptarmigan is through regulation of harvest. Present regulations are set with no knowledge of ptarmigan numbers, the kill, or the effect of one on the other. Lack of access to ptarmigan range restricts the harvest. Greater future demand for ptarmigan as a recreational resource is expected; research is needed to establish a basis for an intelligent management program. This paper discusses the management of rock and willow ptarmigan in North America exclusive of Newfoundland. The questions examined are: (1) To what extent do people utilize ptarmigan? (2) What management procedures have been applied to ptarmigan? (3) What trends in utilization can be expected in the next few decades? (4) What problems may arise from these trends? Familiarity with Alaska has led me to present more details of ptarmigan use and management there than in other regions. Thanks are extended to Robert A. Rausch, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and David R. Klein, Leader, Alaska Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, for their excellent critical reviews of this manuscript. I am grateful to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Branch of River Basin Studies, for the use of unpublished data on the harvest of ptarmigan. Various federal and provincial conservation agencies in Canada gave prompt and courteous attention to requests for information on management practices.

AB  - Model building and data analysis in the biological sciences somewhat presupposes that the person has some advanced education in the quantitative sciences, and statistics in particular. This requirement also implies that a person has substantial knowledge of statistical hypothesis-testing approaches. Such people, including ourselves over the past several years, often find it difficult to understand the information-theoretic approach, only because it is conceptually so very different from the testing approach that is so familiar. Relatively speaking, the concepts and practical use of the information-theoretic approach are much simpler than those of statistical hypothesis testing, and very much simpler than some of the various Bayesian approaches to data analysis (e.g., Laud and Ibrahim 1995 and Carlin and Chib 1995).

AB  - We present the results of a long-term (1970-85) band recovery study of northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) at Tall Timbers Research Station, Leon County, Florida. The mean annual survival rate of male quail (18.7 ? 1.2 [SE] %) was significantly (P = 0.01) greater than that of females (14.3 ? 1.2%). The difference between survival of young (6-9 months old) and adults (>1 yr old) was 3 ? 2.2% and not significant. Survival rates varied significantly among years. The mean harvest was 23.3 ? 0.53%/year. Young male quail were harvested at a significantly higher rate than adult males (2% difference). There was no significant difference between harvest rates of young and adult females. Juvenile male and female harvest rates were not significantly different. However, adult females were harvested at a significantly higher rate than adult males (5% difference). Harvest varied among years. The mean annual kill (harvest rate + crippling loss) was approximately 30% for both sexes. Male and female natural mortality were approximately 52 and 56%, respectively. There was evidence of additivity of hunting and natural mortality for this population harvested in late winter. Our long-term study provides information on the survival processes for northern bobwhite quail that can be used to enhance management of the species. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 53(1):1-6 Although research on northern bobwhite quail began in the 1920's (Stoddard 1931, Errington 1933), studies of quail survival have been limited. Sound management requires good estimates of mortality rates. Mortality for hunted species can be estimated from band recovery data using models prepared by Brownie et al. (1985). These models also provide band recovery rate estimates. Harvest rate is easily obtained if the reporting rate of bands is known. Total kill estimates follow from harvest estimates if an estimate of crippling loss is available. With these data managers can partition hunting and natural (nonhunting) mortality. A recent series of papers questions whether hunting and natural mortality are additive (Anderson and Burnham 1976, Anderson et al. 1982, Nichols and Hines 1983, Burnham and Anderson 1984, Burnham et al. 1984, Nichols et al. 1984). Most of this work applies to waterfowl, particularly mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), for which the most band recovery data are available. We report the results of a long-term bandrecovery study of bobwhite quail at Tall Timbers Research Station, Leon County, Florida. We obtained survival estimates and test the additive and compensatory mortality hypotheses (Anderson et al. 1982). W. L. Cornelius assisted with computing and J. D. Nichols reviewed an earlier draft of the manuscript. We thank present and past coworkers and many biologists and volunteers, especially wildlife technician students at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, for their help. This study was supported in part by Tall Timbers Research Station, Tallahassee, Florida and by an appropriation from the Congress of the United States. Funds were administered and research coordinated under the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act and through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

AB  - In order to estimate the potential importance of each of the demographic traits egg, chick, and apparent winter survival on willow grouse Lagopus lagopus population dynamics, a sensitivity/elasticity analysis on a general model for the growth rate of breeding hen willow grouse numbers was performed. The demographic parameters used were taken from a 21-year study of willow grouse population dynamics on a Norwegian island. The growth rate of breeding hen numbers may be sensitive to changes in a parameter either because of the structure of the model or because of a substantial between year variation in the parameter. Therefore, three measures of parameter importance were used: sensitivity, elasticity and an actual elasticity coefficient (AE-coefficient). Sensitivity is an unsealed measure of the impact of a parameter, and thus cannot be used for comparisons between different parameters. Elasticity is a scaled measure of sensitivity allowing direct comparison between effects of different parameters on the growth rate (λ). To interpret the true effect of a demographic parameter on λ, between year variations in the parameter must be accounted for. The actual elasticity coefficient of each parameter is the product of the elasticity coefficient and the coefficient of variation, CV, for the demographic parameter in question. Sensitivity, elasticity and AE-coefficients showed that apparent winter survival of juveniles had the largest potential impact on changes in X, followed by egg survival, chick survival and adult apparent winter survival. Considering elasticity coefficients alone, apparent winter survival compared to survival from egg laying to four weeks after hatching had 2.3 times the impact on X. However, between year variation in apparent winter survival was far less than between year variation in survival from egg laying to four weeks after hatching, which leads to them both having a similar impact on X. Management efforts on willow grouse have largely been devoted to enhancing survival from egg laying to four weeks after hatching which was believed to be the single most important factor determining population size. The results presented suggest that equal attention should be paid to winter survival. One cause of reduced winter survival may be hunting. A model incorporating the area specific survival and chick production resulted in λ = 1, when chick production was 1.8 chicks per adult and when there was no hunting. The model suggested that grouse could not be hunted in four of the 21 years without reducing the population size on the island and in many years only a modest harvest could be recommended.

AB  - Abstract The grey partridge Perdix perdix used to be a common and widespread species throughout the temperate zone of western Eurasia, but its populations have markedly declined in most parts of its native range since the 1950s. The Pyrenean subspecies P. p. hispaniensis is threatened by alteration of its habitat, and despite ecological and hunting interest in this subspecies, the impact of harvest on population sustainability remains largely unknown. We assessed mortality of Pyrenean grey partridge and its influence on the population growth rate during 1992-2001 in the French Pyrenees. Cause-specific mortality rates were estimated using multistate capture-recapture models based on fates of 67 radio-equipped birds. Annual recruitment was estimated as the ratio of juvenile birds to adult birds in harvested samples. Mammalian predators and raptors were each responsible for a 5% monthly mortality rate. At the peak of hunting activity (i.e. October), hunting was responsible for a 30% mortality rate in some ye...

AB  - Optimal harvesting theories based on the concept of maximum sustained yield assume a stationary distribution of population size, ignoring that extinction is the eventual fate of all populations. We analyze the dynamics of populations at risk of extinction from demographic and environmental stochasticity as well as harvesting. Diffusion theory is used to derive approximate formulas for the mean time to extinction, T, the expected cumulative harvest before extinction, Y, and the mean and standard deviation of annual harvest, ȳ and σy. In numerical examples we compare the performance of different harvesting strategies in terms of these statistics. We derive optimal harvesting strategies that maximize Y or ȳ. The optimal strategies always involve a threshold function in which harvesting occurs at the maximum possible rate above a critical population size, c, with no harvest below c. For a broad class of stochastic population models we show that Y is maximized, with unlimited harvesting capability, when the cr...

AB  - Abstract We estimated relative density, survival, and reproduction of American black bears (Ursus americanus) from capture–recapture and telemetry data collected from 1989 to 1999 in the unhunted Chapleau Crown Game Preserve (CCGP) and nearby hunted areas in the boreal forest of Ontario, Canada. We tested for combinations of effects of age class, sex, year, years of food shortage, encumbrance status, and residency (on or off the Game Preserve) on vital rates. Results from live captures, remote captures, and bait-station hit rates indicated that density was highest inside CCGP. Total survival of adult females, subadults, and cubs were similar among residents and nonresidents of CCGP, but yearling survival was lower among CCGP residents. Adult females were approximately twice as likely to die and nearly 10 times as likely to be cannibalized (risk ratio [RR] = 9.62, 95% CI = 2.088–44.29) while encumbered with cubs of the year. Nonresidents of CCGP had greater risk of being harvested (RR = 4.00, 95% CI = 1.19...

AB  - Commercially important species often are overexploited, and many endan- gered mammals and birds are threatened by hunting and international trade. To sustain biological resources requires harvesting strategies that maximize yield while accounting for stochastic dynamics, uncertainty, and risk of resource collapse or extinction. For a large class of population dynamics, the optimal strategy is to harvest all individuals above a threshold population size, with no harvest below the threshold. Maximizing the expected cumulative harvest before extinction puts the optimal threshold at carrying capacity, re- gardless of the form of expected dynamics or the magnitude of stochasticity. Maximizing the mean annual yield lowers the optimal threshold, which then depends on the form of expected dynamics and the magnitude of stochasticity. Uncertainty in estimated population sizes increases the threshold, and with large uncertainty, the optimal strategy is proportional threshold harvesting, involving harvest of only a fraction of the excess in estimated pop- ulation above the threshold. The theoretical justification for the common strategy of a constant harvest rate is extremely weak in comparison to that for optimal threshold strat- egies. Thresholds are a necessary feature of any harvesting strategy with the objective of minimizing risks of resource depletion or extinction, while optimizing yields.

AB  - Quantitative models of the relationship between annual survival and harvest rate of migratory game-bird populations are essential to science-based harvest management strategies. I used the best available band-recovery and harvest data for mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) to build a set of models based on different assumptions about compensatory harvest mortality. Although these models suffer from lack of contemporary data, they can be used in development of an initial set of population models that synthesize existing demographic data on a management-unit scale, and serve as a tool for prioritization of population demographic information needs. Credible harvest management plans for mourning dove populations will require a long-term commitment to population monitoring and iterative population analysis.

AB  - Ptarmigan ( Lagopus lagopus alexandrae ) in northern British Columbia leave their breeding areas during autumn and winter. The movements differ between males and females. In this study I examine the causes and extent of these differences. Ptarmigan did not leave their breeding grounds immediately after the breeding season, but remained on or near their territories until December. After chicks fledged, part of the population moved uphill from their territories. Coincident with moult into winter plumage, ptarmigan moved farther from their territories. Both movements were probably to areas with better protection against predators. After moulting, all tagged males and half of the tagged females returned to their territories, and males resumed territorial display. Ptarmigan remained on their territories until increasing snow cover depleted cover, forcing them to leave. Males left the breeding grounds later than females and returned earlier in spring. In winter females moved farther than males, supporting the reproductive strategy hypothesis, but segregation was not complete. Sexual segregation may not be related to migration alone, but could occur at any time ptarmigan are in flocks. Key words: willow ptarmigan ( Lagopus lagopus alexandrue ), autumn territoriality, winter movements, sexual segregation, northern British Columbia

AB  - 1. Factual information is key to resolving conflicts between raptor conservation and gamebird management, especially when the conservation status of one of the species involved is threatened. The grey partridge Perdix perdix is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan species because of a marked decline in abundance caused by agricultural intensification. Recently, the number of raptors present on farmland and the commercial shooting of red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa have both increased. To inform conservation action, the relative impacts of these two factors on grey partridge populations urgently require quantification. 2. On our study site areas of low density of grey partridges coincided with areas of high raptor density. However, these areas were managed intensively for shooting and for two areas that suffered local partridge extinction, the 3-year average percentage of partridges shot exceeded 50%. 3. Grey partridge mortality to raptors between autumn and spring lay between 9·5% of autumn density (assumes losses to raptors occurred before shooting) and 15% of post-shooting density (if all losses to raptors were post-shooting). A deterministic model suggested that this rate of loss would reduce the equilibrium density of spring pairs by 11-26% relative to a situation without raptors. In comparison, shooting losses across the study area amounted to 35-39% of autumn density, more than double the losses to raptor predation, with a predicted reduction of 68-85% in equilibrium density of spring pairs. 4. Synthesis and applications. Shooting based on large-scale releases of red-legged partridges acts in a density-independent manner and can lead to local grey partridge extinction. Removing the grey partridge from the UK quarry list would be counterproductive, as most action to boost wild grey partridge densities is carried out by enthusiasts with shooting as the incentive. However, it is imperative that managers of intensive shoots based on gamebird release adopt measures to reduce shooting pressure on wild grey partridges at low density. These include training shooters to distinguish between grey and red-legged partridges and implementing a warning system (whistle) to alert the gun line when birds of the non-target species are approaching. Such voluntary measures are effective in addressing overshooting, which has greater implications for grey partridge conservation than raptor predation.

AB  - Summary     1. Gyrfalcon predation on ptarmigan during the breeding season was studied in north-east Iceland 1981–97. The ptarmigan population went through a complete 10-year cycle of numbers with a 4·3-fold difference in density between high and low years. The yearly number of occupied gyrfalcon territories was correlated with ptarmigan density with a 3-year time-lag. Total falcon numbers in late summer (territorial adults + fledglings) showed a 2-year lag with ptarmigan numbers. Variability in falcon density was significantly less than that of ptarmigan. It is suggested that the factors contributing to the time-lag between the two populations are the year-round residency of falcons on nesting territories, and late maturity (2- to 4-year-old). Mean brood size and the proportion of the territorial falcon population breeding successfully showed no relation to ptarmigan numbers.     2. Ptarmigan density in spring was an important factor determining composition and variability in the diet of gyrfalcons during the breeding season. Alternative prey for falcons included waterfowl, alcids and waders. Adult ptarmigan featured highly in gyrfalcon diet in all years. The functional response curve to changes in ptarmigan density was slightly convex or close to linear and showed relatively little change in the average number of ptarmigan killed per individual predator over the range of ptarmigan densities observed.     3. The impact of gyrfalcon predation on the ptarmigan population and ptarmigan density was in opposite phases, and the predation rate peaked during the decline and the low phase of the ptarmigan cycle. This suggests that gyrfalcons accelerate decline, accentuate the amplitude and affect the length of the low phase of the ptarmigan cycle. The following factors seem to promote the destabilizing effects of predation by gyrfalcons: they are resident specialist predators, they show a delayed numerical response to changes in ptarmigan density and a high utilization of this prey at all phases of the ptarmigan cycle.

AB  - The competing hypotheses of additive and compensatory hunting mortality have not been investigated in Canada geese (Branta canadensis moffitti). Thus, I analyzed band-recovery data consisting of 37,942 bands and 10,451 recoveries from Canada geese banded in Utah during 1952-84. Investigations of the hypotheses of additive and compensatory mortality were conducted on the basis of response of survival rates to variations in harvest regulations, correlation of survival rates with recovery rates, and linear relationships between survival rates and kill rates. Survival rates showed weak relationships to variation in season length, were found to be negatively correlated with recovery rates (adult P=0.016), and showed weak evidence of linearity in relation to kill rates. Whether these relationships are manifestations of additive mortality, or compensatory mortality operating above the threshold point, cannot be determined

The mortality rate of hens during spring and summer was 0.35 but had a sharp peak during egg laying and incubation.

AB  - We used band-recovery data from 2 populations of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), one in Colorado, USA, and another in Nevada, USA, to examine the relationship between harvest rates and annual survival. We used a Seber parameterization to estimate parameters for both populations. We estimated the process correlation between reporting rate and annual survival using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods implemented in Program MARK. If hunting mortality is additive to other mortality factors, then the process correlation between reporting and survival rates will be negative. Annual survival estimates for adult and juvenile greater sage-grouse in Nevada were 0.42 6 0.07 (x ¯ 6 SE) for both age classes, whereas estimates of reporting rate were 0.15 6 0.02 and 0.16 6 0.03 for the 2 age classes, respectively. For Colorado, average reporting rates were 0.14 6 0.016, 0.14 6 0.010, 0.19 6 0.014, and 0.18 6 0.014 for adult females, adult males, juvenile females, and juvenile males, respectively. Corresponding mean annual survival estimates were 0.59 6 0.01, 0.37 6 0.03, 0.78 6 0.01, and 0.64 6 0.03. Estimated process correlation between logit-transformed reporting and survival rates for greater sage-grouse in Colorado was r 5 0.68 6 0.26, whereas that for Nevada was r 5 0.04 6 0.58. We found no support for an additive effect of harvest on survival in either population, although the Nevada study likely had low power. This finding will assist mangers in establishing harvest regulations and otherwise managing greater sage-grouse populations. The notion that mortality associated with predation might be compensated by reduced mortality from other causes dates at least to Errington's ideas about the threshold of security (Errington and Hammerstrom 1935, Errington

AB  - Whether different sources of mortality are additive, compensatory, or depensatory is a key question in population biology. A way to test for additivity is to calculate the correlation between cause-specific mortality rates obtained from marked animals. However, existing methods to estimate this correlation raise several methodological issues. One difficulty is the existence of an intrinsic bias in the correlation parameter. Although this bias can be formally expressed, it requires knowledge about natural survival without any competing mortality source, which is difficult to assess in most cases. Another difficulty lies in estimating the true process correlation while properly accounting for sampling variation. Using a Bayesian approach, we developed a state–space model to assess the correlation between two competing sources of mortality. By distinguishing the mortality process from its observation through dead recoveries and live recaptures, we estimated the process correlation. To correct for the intrins...

AB  - Compensatory mortality or natality can operate as a consequence of seasonally driven mechanisms of density dependence. Our objective is to clarify the relationship between compensation and density dependence in population models for vertebrates when seasonality is present. Field studies of a variety of species have demonstrated that due to compensation, predation or human harvest may not influence spring-breeding or pre-harvest-season densities. Compensation seems to contradict most harvesting and predation models because these models predict that harvests or predation will always reduce equilibrium population size. In these population models sustainable harvests are attainable because of density dependence. The apparent discrepancy is attributable to the failure of most population models to incorporate the details of environmental seasonality. We review seasonally explicit models of population dynamics to illustrate how density dependence is the mechanism behind compensatory mortality and natality. Even though spring-breeding or pre-season densities can remain unaffected or even increased by harvesting, harvesting or predation generally reduces the integral of population size. Compensatory mortality and natality are often cited as the basis for sustainable harvests of wildlife populations.

AB  - Arctic and alpine habitats are extreme environments characterized by short breeding seasons, cold temperatures, limited food availability, and potentially high predation rates. Stringent ecological conditions are likely to have important consequences for the evolution of life history traits, but direct empirical tests are few. We compare the demog- raphy of three populations of ptarmigan on an environmental gradient spanning alpine, subalpine, and arctic habitats. Female Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and White- tailed Ptarmigan (L. leucurus) breeding at subalpine and alpine sites had smaller clutches and lower probabilities of nesting success, fledging success, and renesting than Willow Ptarmigan nesting at a low-elevation arctic site. Annual fecundity, measured as female fledglings per breeding female, did not overlap among the three populations and was ranked: alpine (0.40 6 0.08, mean 6 SE, 95% CI 5 0.26-0.58) , subalpine (1.33 6 0.10, 1.13- 1.54) , arctic (2.04 6 0.18, 1.68-2.39). There was a nonsignificant trend for apparent survival rates (f) of breeding females to vary in the opposite direction: alpine (0.46 6 0.04) . subalpine (0.43 6 0.03) . arctic (0.37 6 0.06). Population growth rates predicted significant declines for the alpine population ( l5 0.65 6 0.07, 95% CI 5 0.52-0.79), but not the subalpine ( l5 1.00 6 0.07, 0.86-1.14) or arctic populations ( l5 1.13 6 0.20, 0.78-1.54). The adjusted estimates of survival necessary to sustain a stationary population indicated that actual variation in female survival was more pronounced than the observed rates: alpine (0.71) . subalpine (0.43) . arctic (0.33). Together, the fecundity and survival values provide evidence that even congeneric populations can exhibit a continuum between high reproductive and survivor life history strategies. Variation in ptarmigan life history traits was consistent with population differences in predation rates on eggs and breeding females, and it was not related to duration of the breeding season, climatic conditions, or food availability. Ptarmigan demography also covaried with body size, but not in the predicted pattern. Overall, the life history strategies of ptarmigan are consistent with our current understanding of the impacts of environmental factors upon life history variation in passerine songbirds.

Alternate models based on a series of random number (or random selections from some other frequency distribution) have expected correlation coefficients very close to those cited as demonstrating density dependence. A "Morris plot" can also be generated from a series of random numbers.

Robust estimates of demographic parameters are essential for identifying population declines and planning effective management. We evaluated the effects of age and season on the survival of female lesser prairie-chickens at 2 sites in southwestern Kansas, USA. Using telemetry data from a 7-year field study (from 1997 to 2003), we estimated seasonal (Apr–Sep) and annual (Apr–Mar) survival. We also examined daily survival rates of females attending nests during the 26-day incubation period and young during the 14-day early brood-rearing period. We evaluated the probable mortality causes of radiomarked birds by examining evidence at recovery sites. We captured 227 female lesser prairie-chickens (87 yearlings, 117 ad, and 23 age undetermined) and fitted them with radiotransmitters. Estimates of 12-month survival were lower among yearlings (Ŝ12 = 0.429...

The data include observations of the autumnal movement of female Rock Ptarmigan from alpine breeding areas to wintering ranges below timberline, observations of the reverse movement in spring, and results of examinations of specimens taken in winter. I first noticed segregation of sexes in ptarmigan in 1959 while collecting winter specimens incidental to research for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Most data were obtained in central Alaska from 1959 through 1963.

AB  - Although sage grouse Centrocercus urophasianus have declined throughout their range in North America, little is known about annual mortality patterns of this species. Thus, we summarize a long-term data set on timing and causes of mortality of sage grouse. Predation was the most common cause of death for radio-marked sage grouse. For adult males, 83% of deaths were attributed to predation and 15% to hunting. However, for adult females, 52% of deaths were caused by predation while 42% were attributed to hunting. We rejected the hypothesis that type of mortality (predation vs hunting) was independent of gender of sage grouse. For males, 70% of deaths occurred during spring and summer (March-August) and 28% occurred in September-October. For females, 52% of mortalities occurred during spring and summer and 46% occurred in September-October. We rejected the hypothesis that time of death is independent of the gender of sage grouse. In six of 15 years (40%), harvest rates for adult females may have exceeded 10% while this rate was only exceeded in two of 15 years (13%) for adult males.

AB  - Band recovery data from over 410 000 adult Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) banded in North America between 1950 and 1979 were analyzed to examine the effect of exploitation on annual survival rate. Two extreme hypotheses were defined; completely compensatory, and totally additive, and an explicit mathematical model was presented to represent each hypothesis. Comparison of the values of the log—likelihood functions at their maxima allowed discrimination between the two models (hypotheses). Extensive Monte Carlo studies were made on the performance of the discriminant test and the power of the test under the two extreme hypotheses and a range of intermediate hypotheses. The results of the discriminant tests on the data agreed closely with the expected performance of the test if the true underlying process was compensatory. We rejected the hypothesis of total additivity (P = .001). Instead, it appears that hunting mortalities are largely compensated for by other forms of mortality. See full-text article at JSTOR

AB  - We assessed sex ratio, annual survival rates and patterns of seasonal mortality of female and male willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in northwestern British Columbia. Annual sex ratio of birds on the breeding area did not statistically differ from a 1:1 ratio over eight years, although in six of the eight years males were more numerous. Over eight years, annual survival, based on return rates of banded birds, was 41–63% for males and 30–54% for females. We analysed seasonal patterns of mortality using radio-tagged birds. During four springs and summers, female survival varied from 74 to 97%. They suffered the highest mortality during late prelaying, incubation and pre-fledging brood rearing periods, and most were killed by raptors. Broodless females survived better (100%) than females accompanied by broods (77%). No radio-tagged males died during two breeding seasons. Survival for both sexes was lower in autumn/winter (40–60%) than in spring/summer (75–100%). In autumn, the highest mortality for both sexes occurred during the late brood rearing and winter moult periods, coinciding with the autumn raptor migration. Both sexes had similar mortality rates over winter, despite separating by habitat. Another peak in male mortality occurred in late winter/early spring during the period of transient territoriality, whereas no females were killed during this time. From 1.4 to 3 times as many males as females were killed by hunters. Higher mortality of males during the hunting season and in late winter may balance the higher mortality of females during the breeding season, resulting in a breeding sex ratio that is close to unity.

AB  - Abstract We conducted a 13-year survival (i.e., time survived since birth) and cause-specific mortality study, divided into 2 phases (Phase I = years 1–6; Phase II = years 7–13), of 302 female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) ≥0.6 years old at capture. The study spanned a period of extreme variability in winter severity (maximum winter severity indexes [WSI] of 45–195) and hunting pressure. Most studies of survival and cause-specific mortality of northern deer have assumed constant survival rates for adults of each sex (≥1.0 yr old pooled) and examined fawns (0.6 ≤ x ≤ 1.0 yr old) separately. We observed U-shaped hazard (i.e., instantaneous risk of death) curves for both phases of the study, indicating that risk of death is highest for younger and older individuals. The estimated hazard for Phase II was generally lower and relatively constant for adults 2–10 years old compared to Phase I, where the instantaneous risk of death began to increase at age 6 years. This difference likely reflected dif...

AB  - Experimental evidence to evaluate alternate conservation policies for harvested populations is currently meager. We used populations of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila growing in test tube microcosms to experimentally evaluate the effects of alternate harvesting policies in a controlled, replicable setting. Simple density-dependent models were effective in predicting patterns of ciliate population growth in the microcosms. We evaluated several univariate models, finding that a Ricker logistic model was a better predictor of ciliate population dynamics than Gompertz logistic, non-linear logistic, or random walk models. Using the Ricker logistic model as a demographic skeleton, we modeled ciliate population dynamics with respect to three alternate harvesting policies (fixed quota, fixed proportion, and fixed escapement), each conducted at four comparable levels of harvest intensity. The parameterized demographic models predicted that fixed quota harvesting would lead to lower mean ciliate abundance and higher temporal variability in ciliate abundance than fixed proportion or fixed escapement policies, with an appreciable risk of extinction, even under the controlled environmental conditions of our experimental system. For each harvesting policy, the intensity of harvest had demonstrable effects on population density. Population variability was higher for fixed quota harvesting than the other policies. The stochastic demographic model successfully predicted heightened extinction risk in the fixed quota system, relative to the other management treatments. Our experimental evidence lends support to the theoretical prediction that fixed quota harvesting is riskier than fixed proportion or fixed escapement policies.

AB  - <jats:p>The sustainability of exploitation is based on density‐dependent renewal of populations: when population density decreases as some individuals are taken, the remaining individuals compensate by surviving or reproducing better. In general there is a trade‐off between two desired outcomes: a high yield and a high remaining population size. A hunting strategy is Pareto optimal if it balances this trade‐off without wasting possibilities of improving the performance in either aspect. Lack of knowledge concerning the age structure, mating system or density dependence operating in a population will very easily cause suboptimality in this sense, whereas utilising knowledge of density dependence may, in some cases, even overcome the conflict between the goals, so that harvesting can increase rather than decrease population sizes. Suboptimal timing of harvesting is an example which not only causes unnecessary harm to a population, but also hampers estimation of the compensatory or additive nature of mortality. A bias towards additivity will be found if hunting and natural mortality overlap in time, and even ‘superadditive’ results are possible. A mortality pattern that appears additive cannot, therefore, be used to deduce that overwinter survival is density independent. These results have consequences to harvest planning. Adjusting the length of the open season is a tool frequently used to regulate the harvest. Since estimated slopes of compensation cannot be assumed to remain constant if the timing of the open season is changed, the effect of a prolonged season will be more drastic than a mere change in kill rates would predict. Such factors are likely to have the strongest effects in species with long harvest seasons, such as many migratory European waterfowl.</jats:p>

AB  - Summary     Human activities have indirectly modified the dynamics of many populations, accelerating considerably the natural rate of species extinction and raising strong concerns about biodiversity. In many such cases, the underlying ‘natural’ dynamics of the population has been modified by human-induced increases in mortality, even if the populations are not exploited or harvested in the strict sense. Both dynamical and statistical models are needed to investigate the consequences of human-induced mortality on the overall dynamics of a population. This paper reviews existing approaches and the potential of recent developments to help form a conceptual and practical framework for analysing the dynamics of exploited populations. It examines both the simple case of an extra source of mortality instantaneously in time, and the theory involved when both risks compete over a continuous time scale. This basic theory is expanded to structured populations, using matrix population models, with applications to the conservation biology of long-lived vertebrates. The type and degree of compensation expected and approaches to detect it are reviewed, and ways of handling uncertainty are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Understanding the impact of human harvest is fundamental to the effective management of many wildlife populations. Such understanding has been elusive because harvest mortality may compensate for other sources of mortality when the mortality process is density dependent. This problem is exacerbated by the ubiquitous positive correlation between harvest regulations and population size: more harvest is allowed when populations are larger. Connelly et al. (2003) studied the impact of harvest regulations on sage-grouse Centrocercus uropha-sianus using three sets of regulations: closed season, 1-bird bag and seven-day season, 2-bird bag and 23-day season. Connelly et al. (2003) reported a generally negative correlation between harvest regulations and increase in number of males on leks for harvest regulations that ranged from a hunting closure to a 23-day season with a 2-bird bag. Because lek sizes were smaller where hunting was closed there was confounding between harvest and population density, maki...

Juvenile and adult grouse were counted in the bag of harvested willow grouse in late August and throughout September at six sites in Sweden and Norway. In addition, numbers of juvenile and adult willow grouse were obtained from line-transect counts at 21 sites in Sweden just before the hunting season started on 25 August. The juvenile:adult ratio from the harvest data, estimated as number of juveniles per two adults, showed similar long-term averages and distributions between all six sites. The results from the line-transect counts revealed an overall higher average and a greater range of production between sites. We suggest that the difference between estimates based on line-transect counts and harvest data are caused by hunter behaviour. Hunte...

Those data illustrate a considerable age and sex segregation among wintering areas: Lobstick Structure birds were disproportionately male, 70% (46% adult male), Javelin Mountain birds were disproportionately female, 78% in 1998–1999 and 77% in 1999–2000. Mokami Hill, produced sex ratios between those of the other two areas: 69% female. Sex segregation on our wintering areas likely resulted from females dispersing farther from breeding areas than males. Because the climates of Javelin Mountain and Mokami Hill are successively warmer than that of Lobstick Structure, females may be selecting wintering areas that produce higher quality...

AB  - Summary     1     Harvest management requires knowledge of whether the harvest is sustainable as a result of compensatory mechanisms, such as dispersal. The effect of recreational harvesting on dispersal patterns in willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus was assessed over four hunting seasons in central Norway.     2     A two-parameter Weibull model was fitted to the observed absolute dispersal distance data using maximum likelihood methods. Estimates of the scale and shape parameters for the dispersal probability distribution were calculated, describing the distribution of observed willow ptarmigan dispersal distances. From the parameter estimates of the dispersal model we estimated the standard deviation of the dispersal displacement relevant for population genetic and spatial population dynamic models.     3     The effect of harvesting on dispersal patterns was examined by testing for differences in the scale and shape parameters of dispersal distance distributions in areas with and without harvest. No effect of harvesting was found, either in adults or juveniles.     4     Breeding dispersal of adult birds was estimated as a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 402 m and shape parameter b = 2·01, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation of σ = 284 m. The dispersal probability distribution of adults was not significantly different from a bivariate normal distribution.     5     Natal dispersal had a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 4206 m and shape parameter b = 1·16, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation σ = 3728 m. The dispersal probability distribution of juveniles was not significantly different from an exponential distribution.     6     Synthesis and applications. Reduction of the population density of willow ptarmigan through harvesting at moderate densities does not seem to affect the dispersal distances. Thus, if there is little or no difference in the dispersal probability distribution in harvested and non-harvested areas there will be only weak or no compensation for the harvest, given that natural mortality and reproduction is the same in both areas. Thus, erroneously assuming compensation of harvest by immigration into a local population can lead to overharvest.

AB  - We investigated the response of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus populations to different levels of exploitation. From 1995 through 2002 we monitored breeding populations in areas closed to hunting, open to limited hunting (1-bird daily bag limit; 7-day season), and open to moderate hunting (2-bird daily bag limit; 23-day season). We used three approaches to assess the effects of hunting on sage-grouse populations. Results were consistent regardless of the method used and indicated that overall, areas closed to hunting had greater rates of increase for breeding populations than areas open to hunting (P = 0.018). Limited or moderate rates of exploitation apparently slowed population recovery for sage-grouse. These effects may have been more pronounced for grouse occupying relatively xeric habitats close to human population centers or highly fragmented habitats. Our results suggest that hunting seasons for sage-grouse should generally be conservative and reflect both sage-grouse population trend and quality of habitat occupied by the population.

AB  - Knowledge of intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with survival rates and the underlying causes of mortality is essential to understand both population dynamics and the causes of population declines. We studied the influence of habitat variables and body condition on survival of 151 radio-tracked Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa in four areas of Spain, representing a gradient from natural unmanaged areas to highly managed areas. We examined the effects of differences in game management practices, and seasonal and geographical variations in survival and causes of mortality over 4 years, from 1999 to 2002. Monthly survival rate was consistently over 90% for both sexes in the natural area. However, in two areas managed intensively for both hunting and agriculture, survival was low during the hunting period (72% for females and 79% for males), high during the breeding period for males (99%), and intermediate for females (89%) due mainly to diseases. Hunting was the main cause of Red-legged Partridge mortality in both hunting areas where driven partridge shooting was performed, affecting 50% of radio-tagged individuals, and was the main cause of mortality over all areas during both breeding and hunting periods. Disease was the next most common cause of mortality in managed areas, affecting mostly females during the breeding period, whereas predation was the main cause of mortality in unmanaged populations. Finally, we compared the habitat associations and body condition of living and dead individuals with varying causes of mortality. In general, high survival rates were associated with diverse vegetation, habitat edges and a good body condition index. Habitat diversity and a high edge index were also negatively associated with mortality due to predation and diseases. On the other hand, hunting mortality decreased with the proportion of scrubland and increased with the proportion of agricultural land. These results suggest that preventing declines of wild Red-legged Partridge populations might best be achieved by increasing landscape complexity and connectivity, and promoting game management practices to limit both partridge bags and long-term densities.

AB  - There are two postulated causes for the observed periodic fluctuations (cycles) in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus). The first involves interaction with the parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis. The second invokes delayed regulation through the effect of male aggressiveness on territoriality. Empirical evidence exists to sup- port both hypotheses, and each hypothesis has been modeled de- terministically. However, little effort has gone into looking at the combined effects of the two mechanisms or formally fitting the cor- responding models to field data. Here we present a model for red grouse dynamics that includes both parasites and territoriality. To explore the single and combined hypotheses, we specify three versions of this model and fit them to data using Bayesian state-space mod- eling, a method that allows statistical inference to be performed on mechanistic models such as ours. Output from the three models is then examined to determine their goodness of fit and the biological plausibility of the parameter values required by each to fit the pop- ulation data. While all three models are capable of emulating the observed cyclic dynamics, only the model including both aggression and parasites does so under consistently realistic parameter values, providing theoretical support for the idea that both mechanisms shape red grouse cycles.

AB  - Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) were marked from 1981 through 1984 and recovered for 5 years in Pool 9, Upper Mississippi River to determine survival and harvest rates by using banding methodology. Tag reporting rate, estimated from trapper interviews, averaged 83 ? 1% and was constant among years. Survival and recovery rates did not vary significantly between sexes but were significantly different between birth-year (BY) and after-birth-year (ABY) animals. Data best fit a model assuming constant age-specific survival and year-specific recovery rates. Constant annual survival rate of BY animals was 15.7 ? 2.3%, whereas survival of ABY animals was 5.8 ? 1.5%. Harvest rates ranged from 17% in 1982 to 45% in 1981, and averaged 32 ? 2% of the fall population in all years and habitats combined. Maximum sustained yield in backwaters was 20% of yield in openwaters although annual survival was not different between habitats. There was a density-dependent increase in nonharvest, birth-to-trapping season survival of juveniles, which compensated for increases in harvest mortality. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 51(2):265-272 The effects of exploitation on populations of vertebrates remains one of the important theoretical and applied questions in wildlife ecology. Originally, basic theory on the intercompensatory nature of mortality factors emerged from studies by Errington (1946, 1956, 1963) on the effects of natural predation in influencing abundance of prey species, particularly muskrats. His concepts on predation were extended to include effects of harvest on populations as a basis for game management (Allen 1954, Hickey 1955). Wagner (1969:269) later concluded that the evidence that "game populations can exist under heavy hunting pressure without obvious effects on their density" was equivocal. Much recent research and discussion has focussed on migratory waterfowl (Anderson and Burnham 1976, Burnham and Anderson 1984, Nichols et al. 1984). Anderson and Burnham (1976:5-9) examined the effect of harvest on annual survival of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and defined the competing hypotheses of "compensatory to a threshold point" and "totally additive," which form the basis for much of this paper. Despite the interest and importance of the effects of harvest on survival, details about mechanisms involved in the relationship between exploitation and population dynamics are poorly known. Therefore, in 1981, I began studies on muskrats on the Upper Mississippi River Fish and Wildlife Refuge (UMRFWR) to examine population responses to exploitation. Muskrats are an ideal study species because: large samples of muskrats are easily captured and marked, population densities vary substantially (Clay and Clark 1985), harvest effort varies in response to changes in trapping conditions (Clark 1986), and they provide a contrast to the studies on migratory waterfowl. Furthermore, practical management of muskrats rests on whether populations respond to changes in harvest in an inversity-compensatory manne (sensu Roseberry [1979]). Clay and Clark (1985) have previously shown density-dependent reproduction (inversity) in Pool 9 populations of muskrats. The task of demonstrating whether compensatory interactions exist between natural mortality and harvest remains. In this paper I examine the effects of harvest on survival, with the goal of contributing to both the theoretical basis for harvesting populations and the management of muskrats. A series of consequences of compensatory theory (Nichols et al. 1984) was examined in light of the Pool 9 studies. These results are an extension and, to some degree, a re-examination of previous results (Clay and Clark 1985) using more data and new techniques. The field work was funded through the Iowa Coop. Wildl. Res. Unit by the Upper Miss. River Basin Comm., U.S. Fish and Wildl. Serv., Iowa Conserv. Comm., and Wis. Dep. Nat. Resour. This is Paper J-12181 of the Iowa Agric. and Home Econ. Exp.

AB  - Abstract Numerous studies of behavior and ecology of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) have depended on radiotagging and telemetry for data collection. Excluding the presumably short-term effects of trapping, handling, and attaching radiotransmitters, researchers often assume that little bias is associated with estimating survival and behavioral parameters associated with this technique. However, researchers have not adequately examined these effects on organisms being investigated and have thus assumed demographic information obtained from such methods are valid. In light of this conjecture, it is imperative to evaluate methodological assumptions to ensure research is statistically valid and biologically meaningful. Therefore, we used Burnham's model and program MARK to analyze survival estimates of individually banded and radiotagged bobwhites during an 8-year period (1997–2004) consisting of 6,568 individuals (2,527 radiotagged) via combined analysis of mark–recapture, dead recovery (via harvest...

AB  - The effect of fall either-sex hunting on eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) populations is a common concern of wildlife agencies. We examined the effect of fall either-sex hunting on survival of radiotagged female wild turkeys from 1989 to 1994 in Virginia and West Virginia. We tested the hypothesis that survival of female wild turkeys did not differ among areas closed to fall hunting, open to a 4-week fall season, or open to an. 8- or 9-week fall hunting season. Mean annual survival rates were higher in the area closed to fall hunting than in regions where fall hunting occurred (P = 0.05). Mean annual survival rates varied within years (P ≤ 0.05). Differences in annual survival rate among areas were attributed to legal hunting (P ≤ 0.01). Poaching was a major mortality factor. Juvenile, yearling, and adult hens had similar survival rates in the areas closed to fall hunting and with 4 weeks of fall hunting (P = 0.39), but survival rates of juveniles were lower (P = 0.03) than those of yearling and adult females in the area with an 8-9-week fall hunting season. Harvest rates of female turkeys averaged 4.3% in the 4-week fall hunted area and 12.3% on the 8-9-week fall hunted area. Higher harvests were achieved on the study area opened only to spring hunting than the combined fall-spring harvests on the other study areas. Total harvest was negatively associated with survival (r s =- 0.90, P = 0.04) on the 8-9-week fall hunted area and positively associated with survival (r s = 0.90, P = 0.04) in the area closed to fall hunting. Spring gobbler-only hunting is suggested for maximum growth in a wild turkey population. Guidelines are presented for fall harvest programs.

AB  - It has been demonstrated repeatedly that the degree to which regulation operates and the magnitude of environmental variation in an exploited population will together dictate the type of sustainable harvest achievable. Yet typically, harvest models fail to incorporate uncertainty in the underlying dynamics of the target population by assuming a particular (unknown) form of endogenous control. We use a novel approach to estimate the sustainable yield of saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) populations from major river systems in the Northern Territory, Australia, as an example of a system with high uncertainty. We used multimodel inference to incorporate three levels of uncertainty in yield estimation: (1) uncertainty in the choice of the underlying model(s) used to describe population dynamics, (2) the error associated with the precision and bias of model parameter estimation, and (3) environmental fluctuation (process error). We demonstrate varying strength of evidence for density regulation (1.3-96.7%) for crocodiles among 19 river systems by applying a continuum of five dynamical models (density-independent with and without drift and three alternative density-dependent models) to time series of density estimates. Evidence for density dependence increased with the number of yearly transitions over which each river system was monitored. Deterministic proportional maximum sustainable yield (PMSY) models varied widely among river systems (0.042-0.611), and there was strong evidence for an increasing PMSY as support for density dependence rose. However, there was also a large discrepancy between PMSY values and those produced by the full stochastic simulation projection incorporating all forms of uncertainty, which can be explained by the contribution of process error to estimates of sustainable harvest. We also determined that a fixed-quota harvest strategy (up to 0.2K, where K is the carrying capacity) reduces population size much more rapidly than proportional harvest (the latter strategy requiring temporal monitoring of population size to adjust harvest quotas) and greatly inflates the risk of resource depletion. Using an iconic species recovering from recent extreme overexploitation to examine the potential for renewed sustainable harvest, we have demonstrated that incorporating major forms of uncertainty into a single quantitative framework provides a robust approach to modeling the dynamics of exploited populations.

AB  - SUMMARY (1) This paper documents demographic causes of population change in red grouse at a moor in north-east Scotland in 1961-78. A fluctuation of about two-fold amplitude in breeding densities occurred in 1963-69, and a five-fold one in 1969-77. (2) Grouse tended to breed well in years of increase and more poorly in years of peak and decline. However, numbers did increase after one summer with poor breeding, and decreased after several summers with good breeding, so good breeding was not necessary for increases, nor poor breeding for declines. There were fewer hens than cocks in spring, and many fewer in some years of decline. (3) Many birds emigrated in summer during decline years. Winter losses were only partly due to deaths in the area, and in most years involved much emigration. Net summer immigration occurred in 2 years of low numbers, and net winter immigration after two summers of poor breeding. Intrinsic processes within the population caused losses more by emigration, and extrinsic processes imposed on the population more by death. (4) The ratio of hens to cocks in spring, the extent of summer emigration, the number of chicks per hen in August, and winter loss were all correlated with one another. Winter loss was the loss best correlated with changes in spring numbers, and the largest single loss. The change in numbers from spring i to i + 1 was correlated with numbers in springs i - 1, i- 2 and i - 3, and most strongly at i- 2. (5) Winter loss could not be used to predict spring numbers because we could calculate it only after the spring counts. Variation in spring numbers, however, could be accounted for by a multiple regression on the previous year's spring sex ratio, the extent of summer emigration, and the number of chicks per hen present in August. (6) We combined these three measures in a chick production ratio (the ratio of half the young birds present in August to the number of adult cocks in spring, and similarly for hens). Changes in spring numbers could be predicted from the observed chick production ratio each year. As the ratio was related to spring numbers 2 years back, we could predict it and so build models predicting grouse numbers several years ahead. (7) Models based entirely on demographic data, with no explicit environmental effect on numbers, fitted observed numbers reasonably well. The only observed extrinsic environmental relationship with numbers was the proportion of nests robbed. Models that incorporated this fitted observed data better. (8) During the decline phase of the second population fluctuation, brood size was lower than in the increase, although not so poor as in the decline during the first fluctuation. Modelling showed that without emigration in summer the reductions in brood size would

AB  - <jats:p>Available data indicate that sage grouse <jats:italic>Centrocercus urophasianus</jats:italic> have declined throughout their range. This species presently occurs in 11 U.S. States and in two Canadian provinces. In nine states having long‐term data, breeding populations have declined by 17–47% (<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="graphic/wlb3bf00129-gra-0001.png" xlink:title="image" /> = 33%) from the longterm average. Six states have long‐term information on sage grouse production. In five of these states, production has declined by 10–51% (<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="graphic/wlb3bf00129-gra-0002.png" xlink:title="image" /> = 25%) from the long‐term average. Habitat deterioration, loss, and fragmentation have reduced the quantity and quality of nesting and early brood‐rearing habitat causing population declines. Factors appearing to be largely responsible for the changes in habitats and, ultimately, sage grouse populations over wide areas of western North America are discussed, and hypotheses that could be tested to provide better insight into sage grouse population declines are suggested. Once these changes are better understood, conservation strategies that address protection and rehabilitation of sagebrush <jats:italic>Artemisia</jats:italic> spp. rangelands should be developed and implemented in each state and province to halt the decline of sage grouse and initiate recovery.</jats:p>

AB  - We review the evidence supporting depensation, describe models of two depensatory mechanisms and how they can be included in population dynamics models and discuss the implications of depensation. The evidence for depensation can be grouped into four mechanisms: reduced probability of fertilisation, impaired group dynamics, conditioning of the environment and predator saturation. Examples of these mechanisms come from a broad range of species including fishes, arthropods, birds, mammals and plants. Despite the large number of studies supporting depensatory mechanisms, there is very little evidence of depensation that is strong enough to be important in a population’s dynamics. However, because factors such as demographic and environmental variability make depensatory population dynamics difficult to detect, this lack of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence that depensatory dynamics are rare and unimportant. The majority of depensatory models are based on reduced probability of fertilisation and predator saturation. We review the models of these mechanisms and different ways they can be incorporated in population dynamics models. Finally, we discuss how depensation may affect optimal harvesting, pest control and population viability analysis.

AB  - Since the Middle Ages, falconers in Asia and Europe, noting the natural propensity of some raptors to hunt in pairs, have flown their birds in casts of two or more birds (Masefield 1914, Wood and Fyfe 1961). With the recent discovery that the Harris' hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus) regularly takes large prey by hunting in groups of three or more individuals (Bednarz 1988, Mader 1976), austringers now fly this raptor in casts of two to many birds (Gehrlein and Gehrlein 1989). Scientists are only now becoming aware that highly developed cooperative hunting may be important for many raptorial birds. Focusing on diurnal raptors, we here define several functional classes that delineate all raptor foraging strategies. Most or all of these classes should apply equally well to other taxa of true predators (i.e., animals

AB  - Summary 1. Traditional understanding of how hunting affects vertebrate populations emphasizes competitive release and density dependence of vital rates, but more recent thinking has proposed complex non-lethal responses to hunting disturbance and predation risk. Colonial species have been proposed to be more vulnerable than dispersed, solitary species to disturbance and perceived risk from hunting. However, empirical comparisons of density dependence vs. risk disturbance in hunted species are few. 2. To compare density dependence with risk-disturbance effects of hunting on individuals and populations of a colonial species, we tested the response of black-tailed prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus to shooting in a before‐after, treatment‐control experiment. We subjected five colonies to a pulse of shooting, and compared individual and colony attributes to those of five control colonies, protected from shooting. 3. Surviving prairie dogs increased alert behaviours eightfold and reduced both aboveground activity and time spent foraging by 66%. Changes in behaviour lowered the body condition of surviving adults by 35%. Survivors of shooting, especially juveniles, exhibited elevated stress levels; faecal corticosterone concentrations increased by 80% among juveniles. Unexpectedly, overwinter survival rates did not increase in response to reduced prairie dog density. Colonies subjected to shooting experienced reproductive near-collapse the summer after shooting; pregnancy rates declined by 50% and reproductive output fell by 82%. 4. Risk-disturbance overwhelmed any possible density-dependent effects of shooting in prairie dogs, which exhibited additive mortality in response to hunting, and reproductive failure 1 year after shooting. Risk-disturbance was the predominant mechanism whereby individuals and colonies were affected by hunting. 5. Synthesis and applications. Because of their coloniality, prairie dogs possess certain life-history traits that predisposed them to be particularly susceptible to huntingassociated disturbances, which had cascading effects on population-level processes. Our findings contradict the general belief that small-bodied mammals quickly rebound from hunting exploitation via compensatory mortality and reproduction. Managers should consider measures to reduce recreational shooting intensity and duration in regions where black-tailed prairie dog colony growth and persistence is desired, yet allow shooting in areas where colonies conflict with landowner interests.

AB  - Summary 1. Recent experiments on cyclic red grouse populations discovered that aggressiveness, induced by testosterone implants, depressed population density for more than a year after the implants were exhausted. 2. This confirms the observation, also made in previous studies of this territorial species, that aggressiveness can determine population density. Additionally, it hints at a form of social memory that sustains the effect of episodes of high aggressiveness after their cause has ceased to exist. 3. We explore the logical consequences of this observation with a simple model of the interaction between population density and aggressiveness. A flexible function describes how aggressiveness changes from year to year as a function of population density. At low densities animals are tolerant to conspecifics and aggressiveness falls from one year to the next. Conversely, at high densities aggressiveness rises. 4. In the model, current aggressiveness is set by aggressiveness in the previous year, and modified by last year’s population density (first version) or by current population density (second version). 5. We assume no particular behavioural mechanism underlying this process but derive conditions under which changes in aggressiveness, effected by density, can generate unstable dynamics. 6. The two versions of the model give fluctuations that differ in period and amplitude but have similar conditions for unstable dynamics. Specifically, the more abrupt the transition from tolerant to intolerant behaviour with increasing density, the more likely are cycles to occur. 7. We show how a previous model of the kinship hypothesis for red grouse cycles can be recast in the current terminology, and how the new models offer a more general way of examining red grouse population dynamics.

AB  - Testing the additive versus the compensatory hypothesis of mortality from ring recovery data using a random effects model.— The interaction of an additional source of mortality with the underlying "natural" one strongly affects population dynamics. We propose an alternative way to test between two forms of interaction, total additivity and compensation. In contrast to existing approaches, only ring–recovery data where the cause of death of each recovered individual is known are needed. Cause–specific mortality proportions are estimated based on a multistate capture–recapture model. The hypotheses are tested by inspecting the correlation between the cause– specific mortality proportions. A variance decomposition is performed to obtain a proper estimate of the true process correlation. The estimation of the cause–specific mortality proportions is the most critical part of the approach. It works well if at least one of the two mortality rates varies across time and the two recovery rates are constant across time. We illustrate this methodology by a case study of White Storks Ciconia ciconia where we tested whether mortality induced by power line collision is additive to other forms of mortality.

AB  - Abstract Survival estimation is an important aspect of population ecology and conservation biology, and radiotelemetry is a major tool for assessing factors influencing survival time in free-ranging birds and mammals. Despite the advantage of telemetry in providing extensive and continuous survival information, telemetry-based survival estimates can be biased or imprecise when methods are misused. Simple cumulative survival estimators like the Heisey and Fuller and Kaplan-Meier methods have underlying assumptions and sampling requirements that commonly remain unverified by researchers. Telemetry studies often limit survival analysis to simple univariate tests that do not consider the range of factors potentially influencing mortality risk in free-ranging animals. Continuous-time modeling approaches like Cox Proportional Hazards or Anderson–Gill methods, or their discrete-time analogues, are superior because they are robust to a range of study design limitations and can handle multiple categorical or conti...

AB  - Despite the importance of compensatory mortality in setting harvest levels, few studies of tetraonids treat it directly. Total compensation for shooting mortality among adults in populations subjected to significant shooting (harvest rate over 5%) has been demonstrated only in Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, and perhaps in Ruffed Grouse Bonasa umbellus. Only in Red Grouse is there direct evidence for total compensation for shooting in juveniles. Considerable indirect evidence for total or partial compensation comes from comparison of densities on shot and unshot areas, density dependent losses, normal sex ratios where only males are shot, and removal experiments showing that replacement birds exist in spring. The indirect evidence is weak owing to lack of control of immigration and doubt about the fate of "surplus" birds. Compensatory natality has rarely been detected in tetraonids.

AB  - where C is the energy consumed, F is the energy content of the faeces and U is the energy content of the nitrogenous wastes (e.g. urine). Similar indices now appear in many entomological papers (Waldbauer 1968; Slansky & Scriber 1982, 1985). Ratios remain an ambivalent issue in biology, as is illustrated in the following quotation: '... there are some serious drawbacks to the use of ratios and percentages in statistical work... [but] ... we should emphasise that ratios may be the only meaningful way to interpret and understand certain types of biological problems' (Sokal & Rohlf 1981). Here I use the nutritional indices ADC and MEC to examine some of the issues involved in deciding on whether to analyse ratios or the parent variables. I conclude that there are considerable costs associated with the use of ratios and little justification for the claim that they provide information not available through analysis of the measured variables.

AB  - I studied predator-prey relationships between goshawk Accipiter gentilis and four species of forest grouse (Tetraonidae) in northern Finland during 1988–1998. The main purpose of my study was to evaluate the impact of goshawk predation and its possible effect on multiannual cycling patterns in grouse numbers. Theoretically specialist predators should tend to cause stable-limit cycles in prey populations if there is a time-lag in the predator's response to prey density and the prey species should be most affected at low densities. Four grouse species, willow grouse Lagopus lagopus, black grouse Tetrao tetrix, capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia, form the main food of the goshawk in boreal forests in northern Finland. Grouse constituted >40% of the goshawk's diet during the breeding season. The impact of predation by breeding goshawks on grouse varied depending on grouse species within 7–32% during the breeding season. Losses were highest for willow grouse and lowest for capercaillie. On average, goshawks took 6% of grouse chicks. On an annual basis breeding goshawks took 2–31% of the August grouse population. The goshawk's share of the total mortality in grouse was also species related. The most reliable estimates were found for black grouse of which 35% were removed and for hazel grouse of which 40% were removed. Goshawks are relatively specialised on forest grouse in northern boreal forests as was demonstrated by a weak functional response of the hawks to changes in grouse density. Breeding goshawks showed no numerical response to changes in grouse density but the production of young tended to lag one year behind black grouse density. The predation rate of goshawks was inversely density dependent on changes in grouse density, which may have had a destabilising effect on the grouse populations. A positive relationship existed between summer predation on willow grouse and changes in the population the previous year.

AB  - Ptarmigan and grouse species (Lagopus spp.) are thought to be able to compensate for a modest harvest because there is a surplus of breeding birds that are prevented from breeding by territory holders. To estimate the degree of harvest-mortality compensation reliably we experimentally harvested 0%, 15% and 30% of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) on 13 estates ranging from 20 to 54 km2 in size during four hunting seasons in Norway according to a regional block design. Population overwinter growth rate was strongly negatively density dependent, but despite this, and contrary to earlier findings, only 33% of the harvest was compensated for. The lack of compensation was probably caused by long-distance juvenile dispersal that was unaffected by the harvest. The need for large-scale management experiments to detect the effects of harvest was clearly demonstrated: lack of compensation was found only when we used the whole dataset and not when the data were analysed by year or block. Our study shows that it is very difficult to demonstrate a population's lack of harvest compensation and warns against using small-scale, out-of-season or poorly replicated studies as a basis for future harvest-management decisions.

AB  - Food habits of three subpopulations of the Gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus were studied in coastal, lakeland and heathland habitats of NE-Iceland by analysis of 2,316 pellets collected from February 1984-July 1985. No coastal and lakeland Gyrfalcons traveled more than 7.5 km to reach areas with plenty of waterfowl or seabirds (average 3.4 km in winter). Heathland falcons traveled farther to reach equally rich areas for these kinds of prey, e.g. in winter 13-33 km (average 12.9 km). Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus mutus was the main prey for all Gyrfalcons constituting 61% of total pellet volume. Rock Ptarmigan was most important during the early phase of the breeding season (April-June) and in autumn and early winter (August-December). Factors determining high vulnerability in spring seem to be behaviour and coloration of males and in late summer, the large number of naive young. Importance of Rock Ptarmigan on heathland territories as measured by pellet volume ranged from 61-100% for the different collection periods, and 8-85% and 13-91% on coastal and lakeland territories respectively. Other prey groups of importance on heathland territories were waders (max. 12%) in summer and wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (max. 20%) and waterfowl (max. 20%) in winter. Lakeland Gyrfalcons increased their take of waterfowl (max. 56%) and waders (max. 13%) in summer and passerines (max. 19%) and wood mice (max. 43%) in winter. Coastal Gyrfalcons had the most variable diet: they increased their take of waterfowl (max. 42%) and waders (max. 21%) in summer and waterfowl (max. 68%) and alcids (max. 38%) in winter. Switching from Rock Ptarmigan to alternate prey involved in most cases a change of hunting habitat, from upland areas to wetland or coastal areas.

AB  - The status of sage grouse populations and habitats has been a concern to sportsmen and biologists for >80 years. Despite management and research efforts that date to the 1930s, breeding populations of this species have declined throughout much of its range. In May 1999, the western sage grouse (C. urophasianus phaios) in Washington was petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act because of population and habitat declines (C. Warren, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, personal communication). Sage grouse populations are allied closely with sagebrush (Artemisia spp.). Despite the well-known importance of this habitat to sage grouse and other sagebrush obligates, the quality and quantity of sagebrush habitats have declined for at least the last 50 years. Braun et al. (1977) provided guidelines for maintenance of sage grouse habitats. Since publication of those guidelines, much more information has been obtained on sage grouse. Because of continued concern about sage grouse and their habitats and a significant amount of new information, the Western States Sage and Columbian Sharp-tailed Grouse Technical Committee, under the direction of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, requested a revision and expansion of the guidelines originally published by Braun et al. (1977). This paper summarizes the current knowledge of the ecology of sage grouse and, based on this information, provides guidelines to manage sage grouse populations and their habitats.

AB  - Chukars (Alectoris chukar) have been introduced throughout the world. Despite this widespread distribution, limited information regarding seasonal survival, probable causes of mortality, and other basic life history characteristics is available to manage this harvested species. We estimated the probable cause of mortality for chukars with radiotransmitters by examining evidence at kill sites. We used model selection to evaluate influences of seasonal effects (fall raptor migration, peak migration, and reproductive period), demographic effects (age and sex), radio weight, and year on survival of chukars in western Utah, USA, by using a known-fate model in Program MARK and 2 years of telemetry data. We captured and randomly fitted 125 individual chukars with 2 different-sized radiotransmitters (97 F, 20 M, 8 sex undetermined). Model selection results showed our top 3 models accounted for 99% of Akaike's Information Criterion weight, and each one had seasonal and year effects. Two-week survival estimates were lower during peak raptor migration in both years and significantly (P 0.91). Annual survival was lower in 2005 (S = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.01–0.09) compared with 2006 (S = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.12–0.31). We documented 95 deaths and classified 56% unknown, 33% avian predation, 8% hunter harvest, and 3% mammalian predation. Our research suggests that predation on chukars is substantial during the peak fall raptor migratory period and that the hunting take under current regulations is relatively small and likely compensatory.

AB  - Indirect measures of population abundance, such as harvest data, are often used to make inference on long term population dynamics when direct data are either not available or are logistically difficult to obtain. However, when harvesting records are used, a common concern is that they may not reflect actual population abundance. We investigated the extent to which harvest data reflected changes in population density of the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus in Great Britain. We used 92 independently managed populations over the period 1977-2000 and examined the temporal and spatial variability of the hunting records and independently obtained count data from each of these managed estates. Three different analyses support the conclusion that grouse hunting records are a reliable indicator of grouse abundance: 1) the number of red grouse shot in autumn showed a tendency to be linearly related to the density of individuals counted in the summer prior to the harvesting, 2) the relationships between the variance and the mean in the harvesting and corresponding count data, calculated over different populations at the same time, or the same locations at different times, were not statistically distinguishable, 3) similar direct and delayed density dependence patterns were observed in hunting records and count data. Our results suggest that red grouse hunting time series are a good proxy for population abundance.

AB  - The scale of mortality due to hunting of quarry birds in Europe raises conservation questions concerning the effect of hunting on their populations. Typical questions relate to the effect on survival, and to geographical differences and temporal trends in hunting pressure. Geographical differences and temporal trends in hunting pressure can be examined using ringing data by constructing indices based either solely on recoveries of dead birds, or combining recoveries and ringing totals. Both types of index may vary through factors unrelated to hunting. Annual survival rates may be calculated from ringing recoveries, either using models based solely on recoveries of dead birds, or combining recoveries and ringing totals. Measuring an effect of hunting on survival rates is best achieved by comparing rates between hunted and non‐hunted populations. Capture‐recapture data may serve the same purpose, but are appropriate only for intensive studies. Deciding whether mortality due to hunting is additive or compens...

AB  - The degree that hunting may influence game populations depends on whether hunting mortality is additional to (additive) or replaces (compensatory) natural-caused mortalities. In response to limited information on the effects of exploitation on eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus (J.A. Allen, 1890)) populations within Cape Cod National Seashore (CCNS), we initiated an investigation of cause-specific mortality using transmitter-equipped cottontails in hunted and nonhunted areas as a way to examine the additive versus compensatory aspect of hunting. Predation caused >70% of all deaths, whereas hunting caused 10% of deaths in the areas sampled. Survival rate was substantially lower among hunted sites (0.05) than at nonhunted sites (0.19) during the winter–spring of year 1, but there was no difference between hunted (0.33) and nonhunted (0.40) sites during year 2. Lower survival in year 1 was likely due to deep and persistent snow that increased vulnerability to predation and probably reduced the prospec...

AB  - Population dynamics of willow ptarmigan Lagopus l. lagopus are dominated by varying numbers of successful recruits to the population. One important component that determines this number is the survival of chicks from hatching to fledging at about two weeks of age. We studied the causes of death of chicks and the effects of intensive, local predator control on chick production in two areas of south-central Norway from 1997–2004. During 1997–2000, 253 chicks were captured and radio-tagged in a 2,000 ha area in Dalsbygda, Norway. Average survival for all years from hatching to two weeks of age was 33%. Predation accounted potentially for up to 73% of all deaths. Research-related deaths accounted for 17% of deaths, while 10% died of other natural causes than predation. In no case did disease or lack of food appear to be the ultimate cause of death. The localisation of broods could not be predicted from brood position the previous day and there was no correlation between brood behaviour and chick death. Intens...

AB  - Most organisms live in changing environments or do not use the same resources at different stages of their lives or in different seasons. As a result, density dependence will affect populations differently at different times. Such sequential density dependence generates markedly different population responses compared to the unrealistic assumption that all events occur simultaneously. Various field studies have also shown that the conditions that individuals experience during one period can influence success and per capita vital rates during the following period. These carry-over effects further complicate any general principles and increase the diversity of possible population dynamics. In this review, we describe how studies of sequential density dependence have diverged in directions that are both taxon-specific and have non-overlapping terminology, despite very similar underlying problems. By exploring and highlighting these similarities, we aim to improve communication between fields, clarify common misunderstandings, and provide a framework for improving conservation and management practices, including sustainable harvesting theory.

AB  - Smith and Reynolds (1992) analyzed recovery and survival rates for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during periods of liberal (1979-84) and restrictive (1985-88) harvest regulations to examine the relationships between harvest and survival. Using a model explicitly relating survival to recovery rates, Smith and Reynolds (1992) concluded that restrictive harvest resulted in higher survival rates for mallards. We reanalyzed these data to examine relationships between survival rates and both harvest and population size. Mallard population size declined (P = 0.038) over the interval in question. Therefore, the apparent relationship between harvest and survival found by Smith and Reynolds (1992) is potentially spurious because kill rates and population size declined from 1979 to 1988

Approximately 40 percent of the autumn population of a 10.4-km2 area was removed by shooting in 3 consecutive years (1967-69). During May of 1971 and 1972, 40 percent of the breeding population of a 7.5-km2 area was similarly removed. Comparisons of annual breeding densities on the experimental and control areas suggested that neither autumn nor spring removals at the 40 percent level depressed rock ptarmigan breeding stocks the following year. There was some evidence that autumn removals may have contributed to higher breeding densities the subsequent spring. In most cases, males shot in the spring were not replaced until the following year. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 39(3):491-495 The Alaska Department of Fish and Game studied the effect of hunting on rock ptarmigan populations in interior Alaska from 1967 to 1972. The ptarmigan hunting season in most of Alaska extends from August through April, but the majority of the harvest occurs during the periods August through September and February through March (Weeden 1963). Annual harvests by sportsmen are small, and most of the hunting pressure is restricted to relatively narrow bands along access routes. With the increase in human population, creation of new roads, and year-round maintenance of existing roads, ptarmigan harvests are expected to increase sharply over the next decade. Experimental removals simulating hunting by sportsmen were conducted in the autumn during 1967-69 and in spring of 1971 and 1972 to determine the effects of such hunting on trends in breeding stocks.

AB  - The Svalbard rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) is an endemic subspecies of rock ptarmigan inhabiting the high Arctic archipelagos of Svalbard and Franz Josefs Land. This ptarmigan species exists at low population densities, with little interannual variations in population numbers, and limited habitat for breeding with less than 5 % of the land area in Svalbard constituting medium to high quality breeding habitat. Unander and Steen (1985) hypothesized, based on a descriptive study, that territories sufficiently attractive for breeding could be a limiting factor of the Svalbard rock ptarmigan population. Here, we use experimental data from a 3-year removal experiment (1984-1986) to test their hypothesis by comparing breeding density, demography (sex and age ratios) and body mass of birds between experimental removal plots and control locations. We found evidence of surplus birds by showing that both sexes of Svalbard rock ptarmigan replaced quickly in vacant territories after removal of the resident birds, and that breeding densities were similar for the experimental and control populations. Replaced males in the breeding population weighed less than males in the initial breeding population and tended to be younger. Experimental harvest during the preceding spring had no effect on male body mass, population sex ratio or the proportion of juvenile males in the pre-breeding population the following spring. The documented surplus of male and female Svalbard rock ptarmigan and a lack of impact on breeding densities from removal of birds leave a proportion available for harvest.

AB  - Sustainable management of wildlife populations can be aided by building models that both identify current drivers of natural dynamics and provide near-term predictions of future states. We employed a Strategic Foresight Protocol (SFP) involving stakeholders to decide the purpose and structure of a dynamic state-space model for the population dynamics of the Willow Ptarmigan, a popular game species in Norway. Based on local knowledge of stakeholders, it was decided that the model should include food web interactions and climatic drivers to provide explanatory predictions. Modeling confirmed observations from stakeholders that climate change impacts Ptarmigan populations negatively through intensified outbreaks of insect defoliators and later onset of winter. Stakeholders also decided that the model should provide anticipatory predictions. The ability to forecast population density ahead of the harvest season was valued by the stakeholders as it provides the management extra time to consider appropriate harvest regulations and communicate with hunters prior to the hunting season. Overall, exploring potential drivers and predicting short-term future states, facilitate collaborative learning and refined data collection, monitoring designs, and management priorities. Our experience from adapting a SFP to a management target with inherently complex dynamics and drivers of environmental change, is that an open, flexible, and iterative process, rather than a rigid step-wise protocol, facilitates rapid learning, trust, and legitimacy.

AB  - Theoretical models have shown that the effect of removing a given proportion of the population can be profoundly different if the harvest takes place late in the season compared to early. We explore the effect of these differences using theoretical models based on the concept of demographic value and empirical data on seasonal patterns of natural mortality risk in two contrasting populations of willow ptarmigan in Norway. Based on the theoretical models, we found that changes in the timing of harvest have a much stronger effect in populations with relatively low annual survival compared to populations characterized by longevity typical for species with slow life histories. Also, the timing of harvest is more influential in cases with constant mortality hazards compared to a situation with density-dependent natural mortality. Empirical data from two study populations of willow ptarmigan showed large deviations from the theoretical predictions of models with both constant and density-dependent mortality hazards. There were also large differences in both the temporal pattern and magnitude of annual survival between the two ptarmigan populations (54 vs 26% annual survival). Site differences illustrate the importance of knowledge of both the magnitude and temporal pattern of natural mortality hazard to be able to correctly predict the effect of changing the timing of harvest in a population. In the two ptarmigan populations, we show how harvest quotas can be adjusted in accordance to the empirical estimates of natural mortality risk and how this determines the effects of shifting from harvesting early to late in the annual cycle.

AB  - P>1. The effects of harvest on the annual and seasonal survival of willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus L. were tested in a large-scale harvest experiment. Management units were randomly assigned to one of three experimental treatments: 0%, 15% or 30% harvest. Seasonal quotas were based on the experimental treatment and estimates of bird density before the hunting season. Survival rates and hazard functions for radio-marked ptarmigan were then estimated under the competing risks of harvest and natural mortality.        2. The partially compensatory mortality hypothesis was supported: annual survival of ptarmigan was 0 center dot 54 +/- 0 center dot 08 SE under 0% harvest, 0 center dot 47 +/- 0 center dot 06 under 15% harvest, and was reduced to 0 center dot 30 +/- 0 center dot 05 under 30% harvest. Harvest mortality increased linearly from 0 center dot 08 +/- 0 center dot 05, 0 center dot 27 +/- 0 center dot 05 and 0 center dot 42 +/- 0 center dot 06 from 0% to 30% harvest, whereas natural mortality was 0 center dot 38 +/- 0 center dot 08, 0 center dot 25 +/- 0 center dot 05 and 0 center dot 28 +/- 0 center dot 06 under the same treatments.        3. Realized risk of harvest mortality was 0 center dot 08-0 center dot 12 points higher than our set harvest treatments of 0-30% because birds were exposed to risk if they moved out of protected areas. The superadditive hypothesis was supported because birds in the 30% harvest treatment had higher natural mortality during winter after the hunting season.        4. Natural mortality was mainly because of raptor predation, with two seasonal peaks in fall and spring. Natural and harvest mortality coincided during early autumn with little potential for compensation during winter months. Peak risk of harvest mortality was 5x higher than natural mortality. Low natural mortality during winter suggests that most late season harvest would be additive mortality.        5. Environmental correlates of natural mortality of ptarmigan included seasonal changes in snow cover, onset of juvenile dispersal, and periods of territorial activity. Natural mortality of ptarmigan was highest during autumn movements and nesting by gyrfalcons Falco rusticolus L. Mortality was low when gyrfalcons had departed for coastal wintering sites, and during summer when ptarmigan were attending nests and broods.        6. Our experimental results have important implications for harvest management of upland gamebirds. Seasonal quotas based on proportional harvest were effective and should be set at < 15% of August populations for regional management plans. Under threshold harvest of a reproductive surplus, 15% harvest would be sustainable at productivity rates >= 2 center dot 5 young per pair. Impacts of winter harvest could be minimized by closing the hunting season in early November or by reducing late season quotas.

AB  - Summary 1. Understanding the interaction among predators and between predation and climate is critical to understanding the mechanisms for compensatory mortality. We used data from 1999 radio-marked neonatal elk (Cervus elaphus) calves from 12 populations in the north-western United States to test for effects of predation on neonatal survival, and whether predation interacted with climate to render mortality compensatory. 2. Weibull survival models with a random effect for each population were fit as a function of the number of predator species in a community (3–5), seven indices of climatic variability, sex, birth date, birth weight, and all interactions between climate and predators. Cumulative incidence functions (CIF) were used to test whether the effects of individual species of predators were additive or compensatory. 3. Neonatal elk survival to 3 months declined following hotter previous summers and increased with higher May precipitation, especially in areas with wolves and ⁄ or grizzly bears. Mortality hazards were significantly lower in systems with only coyotes (Canis latrans), cougars (Puma concolor )a nd black bears (Ursus americanus) compared to higher mortality hazards experienced with gray wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus horribilis). 4. In systems with wolves and grizzly bears, mortality by cougars decreased, and predation by bears was the dominant cause of neonatal mortality. Only bear predation appeared additive and occurred earlier than other predators, which may render later mortality by other predators compensatory as calves age. Wolf predation was low and most likely a compensatory source of mortality for neonatal elk calves. 5. Functional redundancy and interspecific competition among predators may combine with the effects of climate on vulnerability to predation to drive compensatory mortality of neonatal elk calves. The exception was the evidence for additive bear predation. These results suggest that effects of predation by recovering wolves on neonatal elk survival, a contentious issue for management of elk populations, may be less important than the composition of the predator community. Future studies would benefit by synthesizing overwinter calf and adult-survival data sets, ideally from experimental studies, to test the roles of predation in annual compensatory and additive mortality of elk.

AB  - Summary 1. Invasive and overabundant species are an increasing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning world-wide. As such, large amounts of money are spent each year on attempts to control them. These efforts can, however, be thwarted if exploitation is compensated demographically or if populations simply become too numerous for management to elicit an effective and rapid functional response. 2. We examined the influence of these mechanisms on cause-specific mortality in lesser snow geese using multistate capture–reencounter methods. The abundance and destructive foraging behaviours of snow geese have created a trophic cascade that reduces (sub-) Arctic plant, insect and avian biodiversity, bestowing them the status of ‘overabundant’. 3. Historically, juvenile snow geese suffered from density-related degradation of their saltmarsh brood-rearing habitat. This allowed harvest mortality to be partially compensated by nonharvest mortality (process correlation between mortality sources: q = � 0� 47; 90% BCI: � 0� 72 to � 0� 04). Snow goose family groups eventually responded to their own degradation of habitat by dispersing to non-degraded areas. This relaxed the pressure of density dependence on juvenile birds, but without this mechanism for compensation, harvest began to have an additive effect on overall mortality (q =0 � 60; 90% BCI: � 0� 06 to 0� 81). In adults, harvest had an additive effect on overall mortality throughout the 42-year study (q =0 � 24; 90% BCI: � 0� 59 to 0� 67). 4. With the aim of controlling overabundant snow geese, the Conservation Order amendment to the International Migratory Bird Treaty was implemented in February of 1999 to allow for harvest regulations that had not been allowed since the early 1900s (e.g. a spring harvest season, high or unlimited bag limits and use of electronic calls and unplugged shotguns). Although harvest mortality momentarily increased following these actions, the increasing abundance of snow geese has since induced a state of satiation in harvest that has driven harvest rates below the long-term average. More aggressive actions will thus be needed to halt the growth and spread of the devastating trophic cascade that snow geese have triggered. 5. Our approach to investigating the impacts of population control efforts on cause-specific mortality will help guide more effective management of invasive and overabundant species world-wide.

AB  - Abstract The paper contains new results on the impact of harvesting times and intensities on the stability properties of Seno population models. It is proved that sufficiently high harvest intensities are stabilizing for any harvesting time in the sense that they create a positive equilibrium that attracts all positive solutions. Moreover, in the special case that the nonlinearity in the Seno model is a Ricker function, we derive a global stability result independent of timing and valid for low to medium harvesting efforts. The proof is based on a characterization of those harvesting intensities which guarantee a negative Schwarzian derivative for all harvesting times. Finally, we rigorously show that timing can be stabilizing as well as destabilizing by itself. In particular, a recent conjecture formulated by Cid et al. (2014) [1] is shown to be false.

AB  - In a world undergoing massive declines in the distribution and abundance of many wildlife species, documenting basic ecological characteristics is often needed to be able to understand and potentially mitigate current and future pressures. Species living in alpine areas might be particularly vulnerable to climate change, in part because they are less likely to be able to migrate to new suitable areas. Here we report from a two year case study of rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) in central Scandinavia. Ptarmigan were captured in winter (n=84), and fitted with radio collars. We estimated the natural survival from mid-winter to late summer to be 0.55 (SE: 0.07), with no distinct differences between juveniles and adults, sex, or between the two years. Natural survival through late winter (February – April) was estimated at 0.77 (SE: 0.05), survival trough breeding season May-July at 0.65 (SE: 0.08), and harvest mortality through the February winter harvest at 9% (SE: 3%). Moreover, we documented large scale movement from the wintering grounds before the breeding season in the spring. The longest recorded movement was 79.5 km, and the mean distance from the capture site for birds still in the sample in May-July was 20.3 (SD: 18) km. We discuss the implications of the results in terms of ongoing climate change.

AB  - Populations of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercns urophasianus) have declined by 69-99% from historic levels, and information on population dynamics of these birds at a landscape scale is essential to informed management. We examined the relationships between hen survival and a suite of landscape-scale habitat and environmental conditions. We radio- marked 237 female Sage-Grouse and measured 426 vegetation plots during 2001-2004 at four sites in a 3200-km2 landscape in north-central Montana, USA. We used program MARK to model monthly survival rates for 1 1 seasonal intervals. There was strong support for the best- approximating model (AIQ weight = 0.810), which indicated that (1) hen survival varied by season within years and by year within seasons, (2) nesting hens had higher nesting-season survival than non-nesting hens, and (3) individuals at one site had lower hunting-season survival than at other sites. We observed considerable variation in hen survival. Process variation was 0.255, with an expected range of annual survival of 0.12 to 1.0. The ratio of process to total variation was 0.999, indicating that observed variation was real and not attributable to sampling variation. We observed a nearly fourfold difference in maximum and minimum annual survival, ranging from 0.962 ± 0.024 (mean ± se) for nesting hens in 2001- 2002 to 0.247 ± 0.050) for non-nesters in 2003-2004. Low annual survival in 2003 resulted from the compounded effects of a West Nile virus outbreak in August and a severe winter in 2003-2004. Increased hen mortality associated with severe winter weather contrasts with prior beliefs that Sage-Grouse populations are typically unaffected by winter weather conditions and underscores the importance of protecting winter sagebrush {Artemisia spp.) habitats.

AB  - Abstract We surveyed red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus using pointing dogs in spring and again in summer from 2000 to 2010 on four moors in northern England using a line-transect distance sampling method. We compared density estimates generated with those obtained using three other methods on the same moors: counts of calling males within sample blocks of 0.5-km2, absolute counts of grouse within sample blocks of 0.5-km2 using a line of beaters and gamekeepers' own transect counts obtained using their dogs. We found that distance estimates were positively correlated with abundance estimates from all three sampling methods. Our distance sampling estimates of males pre-breeding were 47% higher than call count estimates, with pre-breeding distance sampling estimates 65% higher than the absolute counts. Distance sampling along transects across the whole moor provides a method for extensive surveys of red grouse, generating estimates of grouse population size at a moor level which can be directly related to ...

AB  - Harvest limits are an important component of wildlife management but evaluating whether realized harvest rates are close to established regulations is often not done in practice. Also, managers typically only partially control harvest rates via changes to metrics such as season length and hunting party size, but the relationships between these proxies and harvest rate are often unknown. We studied a population of northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus over a three-year period to estimate harvest, survival and relationships between harvest rate and proxies of hunting pressure. We captured and marked bobwhite with only bands (n = 479) or bands and radio-transmitters (n = 592). We monitored radio-marked individuals weekly until radio failure, lost signal or death. A comparison of annual survival rates indicated birds marked with only bands survived at similar rates (14.5%, 95% CI: 7.6, 21.4%) compared to those marked with both bands and radio-transmitters (10.6%, 95% CI: 7.9, 13.3%). A cumulative incidence function for cause-specific mortality produced an annual harvest rate estimate of 12.0% (95% CI: 8.6, 15.4%). However, this estimate was likely negatively biased in the presence of undocumented crippling loss. We also derived a 14.4% annual harvest rate using average observed levels of hunting pressure and a joint live–dead model that was not dependent on classification of mortality sources. We predicted annual harvest rates over a range of population sizes and hunting pressures to inform managers of possible thresholds to target. Hunting pressure was an important predictor of harvest rate. For instance, we estimated that adding approximately two more hunters per week would push seasonal harvest rates past the targeted harvest threshold, indicating managers should carefully regulate hunting pressure to avoid exceeding set harvest limits. Estimating relationships between weekly survival and hunting pressure can provide information to evaluate different management scenarios and help develop hunting regulations.

AB  - Mountain lions (Puma concolor) are widely hunted for recreation, population control, and to reduce conflict with humans, but much is still unknown regarding the effects of harvest on mountain lion population dynamics. Whether human hunting mortality on mountain lions is additive or compensatory is debated. Our primary objective was to investigate population effects of harvest on mountain lions. We addressed this objective with a management experiment of 3 years of intensive harvest followed by a 6-year recovery period. In December 2000, after 3 years of hunting, approximately 66% of a single game management unit within the Blackfoot River watershed in Montana was closed to lion hunting, effectively creating a refuge representing approximately 12% (915km 2 ) of the total study area (7,908km 2 ). Hunting continued in the remainder of the study area, but harvest levels declined from approximately 9/1,000km 2 in 2001 to 2/1,000km 2 in 2006 as a result of the protected area and reduced quotas outside. We radiocollared 117 mountain lions from 1998 to 2006. We recorded known fates for 63 animals, and right-censored the remainder. Although hunting directly reduced survival, parameters such as litter size, birth interval, maternity, age at dispersal, and age of first reproduction were not significantly affected. Sensitivity analysis showed that female survival and maternity were most influential on population growth. Life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) demonstrated the effect of hunting on the population dynamics of mountain lions. In our non-hunted population, reproduction (kitten survival and maternity) accounted for approximately 62% of the variation in growth rate, whereas adult female survival accounted for 30%. Hunting reversed this, increasing the reliance of population growth on adult female survival (45% of the variation in population growth), and away from reproduction (12%). Our research showed that harvest at the levels implemented in this study did not affect population productivity (i.e., maternity), but had an additive effect on mountain lion mortality, and therefore population growth. Through harvest, wildlife managers have the ability to control mountain lion populations. Published 2014. Thisarticle is a U.S. Government work and isin thepublic domain in the USA.

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Understanding population dynamics is central to population management, particularly for game species that experience human harvest and non‐harvest mortality. Ruffed grouse (<jats:italic>Bonasa umbellus</jats:italic>) are a widely distributed and common game species in North America that have experienced population declines along their southern range margins, including portions of New England, primarily in response to forest succession and habitat loss. In the state of Maine, ruffed grouse are generally considered abundant, but there is a lack of state‐specific knowledge of ruffed grouse survival and harvest rates to inform harvest management. We estimated seasonal and annual survival rates, harvest rates, and documented cause‐specific mortality of 248 radio‐marked ruffed grouse at 2 study areas in central Maine from 2014 to 2016. We used Program MARK to evaluate sources of spatial, temporal, and individual variation that may affect ruffed grouse survival and harvest. Survival was lowest during October and during winter, and adult ruffed grouse had a higher survival probability than juveniles throughout the year with mean annual survival probabilities of 0.28 ± 0.01 (SE) and 0.13 ± 0.003, respectively. Harvest rates were greater in a state‐owned Wildlife Management Area and were lower within commercially managed private forest that was open to public hunting. Harvest results suggest harvest (<jats:italic>H</jats:italic>) was greatest at the beginning of the hunting season (Oct; Frye Mountain <jats:italic>H</jats:italic><jats:sub>Oct</jats:sub> = 0.14 ± 0.02; Stud Mill <jats:italic>H</jats:italic><jats:sub>Oct</jats:sub> = 0.07 ± 0.02), and was lower later in the season (Nov and Dec; Frye Mountain <jats:italic>H</jats:italic><jats:sub>Nov‐Dec</jats:sub> = 0.07 ± 0.02; Stud Mill <jats:italic>H</jats:italic><jats:sub>Nov‐Dec</jats:sub> = 0.03 ± 0.01). Pooled across all years and study areas, the ruffed grouse harvest rate was 0.16 (95% CI = 0.14–0.18). Our results are comparable to other range‐wide studies and suggest that current hunting regulations for ruffed grouse in Maine are consistent with sustainable population management. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.</jats:p></jats:sec>

AB  - Biologists in Oregon, USA, have routinely collected information on forest grouse populations over a 31-year period (1981–2011) by 3 methods; however, it is unknown how well these methods detected variation in forest grouse abundance over time. We compared brood surveys, collection of hunter-harvested grouse parts (wings and tails), and hunter-harvest surveys to determine which annual survey was most useful as an index to forest grouse population trends in northeastern Oregon. All 3 surveys tracked both dusky (Dendragapus obscurus) and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) through 2 peaks in abundance separated by 14 years; however, stochastic variation resulting from small sample sizes reduced annual correlations among the methods. Grouse wing and tail collection was more informative than the other 2 indices because it exhibited the least annual variation, as well as provided estimates of both reproductive success and population size. Usefulness of hunter surveys was limited by funding, quality control, and lack of information on reproductive success. Brood surveys were the least useful of these indices because of inadequate sample sizes, particularly for ruffed grouse. The primary advantage of the brood survey was that it was available prior to the hunting season and could potentially help forecast the number of grouse available for the autumn hunting season. We recommend that grouse wing collections be continued, that consistency of hunter surveys be emphasized, and that sample size of brood surveys be increased to provide more reliable data. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - 1. Understanding the role of predation in shaping the dynamics of animal communities is a fundamental issue in ecological research. Nevertheless, the complex nature of predator–prey interactions often prevents researchers from modelling them explicitly.     2. By using periodic Leslie–Usher matrices and a simulation approach together with parameters obtained from long-term field projects, we reconstructed the underlying mechanisms of predator–prey demographic interactions and compared the dynamics of the roe deer–red fox–Eurasian lynx–human harvest system with those of the moose–brown bear–gray wolf–human harvest system in the boreal forest ecosystem of the southern Scandinavian Peninsula.     3. The functional relationship of both roe deer and moose λ to changes in predation rates from the four predators was remarkably different. Lynx had the strongest impact among the four predators, whereas predation rates by wolves, red foxes, or brown bears generated minor variations in prey population λ. Elasticity values of lynx, wolf, fox and bear predation rates were −0·157, −0·056, −0·031 and −0·006, respectively, but varied with both predator and prey densities.     4. Differences in predation impact were only partially related to differences in kill or predation rates, but were rather a result of different distribution of predation events among prey age classes. Therefore, the age composition of killed individuals emerged as the main underlying factor determining the overall per capita impact of predation.     5. Our results confirm the complex nature of predator–prey interactions in large terrestrial mammals, by showing that different carnivores preying on the same prey species can exert a dramatically different demographic impact, even in the same ecological context, as a direct consequence of their predation patterns. Similar applications of this analytical framework in other geographical and ecological contexts are needed, but a more general evaluation of the subject is also required, aimed to assess, on a broader systematic and ecological range, what specific traits of a carnivore are most related to its potential impact on prey species.

AB  - The exploitation of non-timber forest products may be an opportunity to reconcile the utilization of biological resources with biodiversity conservation. In Southern Brazil, the exploitation of liana stems for handicraft makes up an important part of the income of indigenous Kaingang people. In this study we evaluated the effects of stem harvesting on the survivorship of Forsteronia glabrescens Müll.Arg, the most exploited liana species in the region. We marked and monitored the survivorship, sprouting, changes in stem diameter and resource yield in control and harvested plots with two different resting times-six and twelve months. We associated variables of interest with individual attributes, harvesting regime and vegetation descriptors through linear mixed modelling. Survivorship and resource yield were lower in the harvested groups than in the control group, although the mean stem diameter was higher. Plants with larger stem diameter presented higher survival odds. Either six or twelve months of resting between harvests were not sufficient to recompose the yield and compensate mortality. Harvesting twice a year increases yield but reduces survivorship. Our results point that the sustainable exploitation of F. glabrescens require either large areas, low pressure or resting periods longer than the ones we tested.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                    <jats:p>Under the 2013 Reform of the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), fisheries management aims to ensure that, within a reasonable time frame, the exploitation of marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested stocks above levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The CFP also calls for the implementation of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management (EBFM). In this paper, we present the concept of maximum sustainable dead biomass (MSDB) and its associated management reference points for fishing mortality and spawning-stock biomass as alternatives to those associated with MSY. The concept of MSDB is illustrated by a dynamic pool production model of a virtual fish stock which takes into account variations in natural mortality (M), fishing mortality (F), and exploitation pattern. Our approach implies a compensatory mechanism whereby survivors may benefit from compensatory density dependence and is implemented through progressive substitution of M with F for varying rates of total mortality (Z). We demonstrate that the reference points for fishing mortality and spawning-stock biomass associated with MSDB are less sensitive to increasing compensation of M with F than those associated with MSY and more sensitive to changes in selection pattern. MSDB-based reference points, which are consistent with maximum stock productivity, are also associated with lower fishing mortality rates and higher stock biomasses than their MSY-based counterparts. Given that selection pattern can be influenced through fishery input measures (e.g. technical gear measures, decisions on areas, and/or times of fishing), whereas variations of M in response to F are not controllable (indeed poorly understood), that the results of many fish stock assessments are imprecise, that maximum stock productivity corresponds to MSDB and that MSY-based reference points may best be considered as limits, we propose that MSDB-based reference points provide a more appropriate basis for management under an EBFM.</jats:p>

AB  - The influence of harvest on wild populations has been the focus of substantial debate, and has widespread implications for the management of wild populations. Traditional views of harvest are based on density-dependent responses of populations to harvest. However, alternate mechanisms can and do induce compensation (e.g., individual heterogeneity). Selective harvest of successful females and their offspring is thought to occur in some grouse populations (e.g., blue grouse [Dendragapus spp.], greater sage-grouse [Centrocercus urophasianus]), and delaying harvest within a season has been proposed as a viable strategy to overcome this type of selective harvest. However, a recent examination regarding the effects of harvest on greater sage-grouse strongly criticized the recommendation of delayed harvest. Herein, we address the criticism of the delayed harvest strategy and provide an examination of projecting the effects of harvest in the face of individual heterogeneity using deterministic projection models. We demonstrate that under proportional harvesting strategies, given a fixed harvest rate, early additive harvest does not have a larger effect on the population than additive harvest later in the season. Moreover, we show that when higher quality individuals (i.e., individuals with higher survival and reproductive rates) are more susceptible to harvest, individual heterogeneity in harvest effects will induce depensatory dynamics when density-dependent effects are only additive. Conversely, even when density-dependent effects are additive, if lower quality individuals are more susceptible to harvest, heterogeneity will induce partial compensation. Reducing the selectivity of harvest on higher quality individuals (i.e., shifting harvest onto lower quality groups) could reduce the risk of artificial selection and induce partial compensation. Therefore, we recommend managers consider the spatiotemporal patterns of populations and time harvest to maximize the heterogeneity tradeoff between higher and lower quality individuals. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.

Al final del ano establecieron un objetivo nuevo y mas ambicioso que consistia en evitar las extinciones de especies en 2020. Lograr dicho objetivo requerira una utilizacion mucho mas eficiente de los recursos y la investigacion tiene un papel fundamental en hacer que esto ocurra.

AB  - <jats:p>The Arabian Partridge (Alectoris melanocephala), is an endemic bird species of the Arabian Desert that lives in groups and inhabits rocky hillsides with patchy vegetation. Throughout their range, Arabian Partridges contend with hunting and habitat destruction, factors that may limit their distribution and abundance. Although the abundance of this species has been assumed to be stable, no actual estimate of its population size has been undertaken. We assessed the distribution and estimated the abundance of the Arabian Partridge at the northern boundary of its range in Saudi Arabia. The estimated density and abundance of the Arabian Partridge in Harrat Uwayrid Biosphere Reserve was 25.6 (6.16 SE) birds/km2 and ~118 individuals, respectively, with higher numbers of individuals in less disturbed sites and near rocky outcrops and hillsides. In sites where hunting occurred, as indicated by the presence of hunting shelters, partridge numbers were extremely low or absent. Our study provides the first quantitative assessment of the Arabian Partridge at the northern limit of its range and highlights the need to reduce threats from hunting, livestock grazing, and feral donkeys and to undertake conservation measures to mitigate factors associated with partridge decline.</jats:p>

AB  - The impact of increasing vertebrate predator numbers on bird populations is widely debated among the general public, game managers and conservationists across Europe. However, there are few systematic reviews of whether predation limits the population sizes of European bird species. Views on the impacts of predation are particularly polarised in the UK, probably because the UK has a globally exceptional culture of intensive, high-yield gamebird management where predator removal is the norm. In addition, most apex predators have been exterminated or much depleted in numbers, contributing to a widely held perception that the UK has high numbers of mesopredators. This has resulted in many high-quality studies of mesopredator impacts over several decades. Here we present results from a systematic review of predator trends and abundance, and assess whether predation limits the population sizes of 90 bird species in the UK. Our results confirm that the generalist predators Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Crows (Corvus corone and C. cornix) occur at high densities in the UK compared with other European countries. In addition, some avian and mammalian predators have increased numerically in the UK during recent decades. Despite these high and increasing densities of predators, we found little evidence that predation limits populations of pigeons, woodpeckers and passerines, whereas evidence suggests that ground-nesting seabirds, waders and gamebirds can be limited by predation. Using life-history characteristics of prey species, we found that mainly long-lived species with high adult survival and late onset of breeding were limited by predation. Single-brooded species were also more likely to be limited by predation than multi-brooded species. Predators that depredate prey species during all life stages (i.e. from nest to adult stages) limited prey numbers more than predators that depredated only specific life stages (e.g. solely during the nest phase). The Red Fox and non-native mammals (e.g. the American Mink Neovison vison) were frequently identified as numerically limiting their prey species. Our review has identified predator-prey interactions that are particularly likely to result in population declines of prey species. In the short term, traditional predator-management techniques (e.g. lethal control or fencing to reduce predation by a small number of predator species) could be used to protect these vulnerable species. However, as these techniques are costly and time-consuming, we advocate that future research should identify land-use practices and landscape configurations that would reduce predator numbers and predation rates.

AB  - Animal behaviour, social structure and population dynamics affect community structure, interspecific interactions, and a species' resilience to harvesting. Building on new life history information for the straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) from multiple localities across Africa, we used survival analyses based on tooth-cementum annuli data to test alternative hypotheses relating to hunting pressure, demography and population connectivity. The estimated annual survival probability across Africa was high (≥ 0.64), but was greatest in colonies with the highest proportion of males. This difference in sex survival, along with age and sex capture biases and out-of-phase breeding across the species' distribution, leads us to hypothesize that E. helvum has a complex social structure. We found no evidence for additive mortality in heavily hunted populations, with most colonies having high survival with constant risk of mortality despite different hunting pressure. Given E. helvum's slow life history strategy, similar survival patterns and rate among colonies suggest that local movement and regional migration may compensate for local excess hunting, but these were also not clearly detected. Our study suggests that spatio-temporal data are necessary to appropriately assess the population dynamics and conservation status of this and other species with similar traits.

AB  - Identifying the factors causing mortality over life is of great importance in gerontology, ecology and evolution. I first present some general methods to properly estimate age-related causes of mortality. Second, I report some of the studies that have quantified the main causes of mortality affecting wild boar over life, an emblematic game species that has dramatically increased in abundance and distribution across Europe. Hunting is the major cause of mortality, followed by natural mortality (e.g. starvation, senescence) and predation, all these factors of mortality being age- and/or sex-specific. Third, I discuss why it is important to examine how some sources of mortality can interact. Finally, I show how hunting can select for accelerated life history that allows wild boar to compensate high mortality probabilities with high reproductive output.

AB  - Demographic links among fragmented populations are commonly studied as source-sink dynamics, whereby source populations exhibit net recruitment and net emigration, while sinks suffer net mortality but enjoy net immigration. It is commonly assumed that large, persistent aggregations of individuals must be sources, but this ignores the possibility that they are sinks instead, buoyed demographically by immigration. We tested this assumption using Bayesian integrated population modelling of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) at their largest wintering site (Wexford, Ireland), combining capture-mark-recapture, census and recruitment data collected from 1982 to 2010. Management for this subspecies occurs largely on wintering areas; thus, study of source-sink dynamics of discrete regular wintering units provides unprecedented insights into population regulation and enables identification of likely processes influencing population dynamics at Wexford and among 70 other Greenland white-fronted goose wintering subpopulations. Using results from integrated population modelling, we parameterized an age-structured population projection matrix to determine the contribution of movement rates (emigration and immigration), recruitment and mortality to the dynamics of the Wexford subpopulation. Survival estimates for juvenile and adult birds at Wexford and adult birds elsewhere fluctuated over the 29-year study period, but were not identifiably different. However, per capita recruitment rates at Wexford in later years (post-1995) were identifiably lower than in earlier years (pre-1995). The observed persistence of the Wexford subpopulation was only possible with high rates of immigration, which exceeded emigration in each year. Thus, despite its apparent stability, Wexford has functioned as a sink over the entire study period. These results demonstrate that even large subpopulations can potentially be sinks, and that movement dynamics (e.g. immigration) among winters can dramatically obscure key processes driving subpopulation size. Further, novel population models which integrate capture-mark-recapture, census and recruitment data are essential to correctly ascribing source-sink status and accurately informing development of site-safeguard networks.

AB  - We estimated fall (10 Sep–8 Nov) survival rates, cause-specific mortality rates, and determined the magnitude and sources of mortality of 1,035 radio-marked American woodcock (Scolopax minor) in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin during 2001–2004. In all 3 states, we radio-marked woodcock on paired study areas; 1 of which was open to hunting and expected to receive moderate to high hunter use and the other of which was either closed to hunting (Michigan and Minnesota) or was relatively inaccessible to hunters (Wisconsin). We used Program MARK to estimate fall survival rates, to evaluate a set of candidate models to examine the effects of hunting and several covariates (sex, age, year, state) on survival, and to examine the relationship between survival rates and kill rates due to hunting. Hunting accounted for 70% of the 86 woodcock deaths in the hunted areas, followed by predation (20%) and various other sources of mortality (10%). Woodcock deaths that occurred in the non-hunted and lightly hunted areas (n = 50) were caused by predators (46%), hunting (32%), and various other sources (22%). Based on small-sample corrected Akaike's Information Criterion values, variation in fall survival of woodcock was best explained by treatment (i.e., hunted vs. non-hunted), year, and period (pre-hunting season intervals vs. hunting season intervals). The average fall survival estimate from our best model for woodcock in the non-hunted areas (0.893, 95% CI = 0.864–0.923) was greater than the average for the hunted areas (0.820, 95% CI = 0.786–0.854 [this estimate includes data from the lightly hunted area in Wisconsin]), and the average treatment effect (i.e., greater survival rates in non-hunted areas) was 0.074 (95% CI = 0.018–0.129). The kill rate due to hunting was 0.120 (95% CI = 0.090–0.151) when data were pooled among states and years. We detected a negative relationship between hunting kill rates and survival in our hunted areas, which suggests that hunting mortality was at least partially additive during fall. Our results illustrate the influence of hunting relative to other sources of mortality in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, and indicate that managers may be able to influence fall survival rates by manipulating hunting regulations or access on public land. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - <jats:p>Predation is a fundamental aspect of ecology that drives ecosystem structure and function. A better understanding of predation can be facilitated by using electronic tags that log or transmit positions of predator or prey species in natural settings, however, there are special considerations that must be made to avoid biased estimates. We provide an overview of the tools available for studying predation with electronic tags including the tag types and analytical tools that can be used to identify where, when and how prey are killed by predators. We also discuss considerations for experimental design when studying predation using electronic tags, including how to minimize effects of capture and tagging procedures. Ongoing innovation and integration of sensors for tags will provide more detailed data about the performance of tagged predators and the fate of tagged prey. Where analysts can effectively resolve the timing of predation using state‐of‐the‐art tags and analytical tools, we foresee exciting advances in our understanding of animal demographics, evolutionary trajectories and management systems. Prospects to develop new tools and approaches for tracking predation while designing studies to more effectively limit bias are an important frontier for understanding ecosystems and addressing human–wildlife conflicts. Given great uncertainties about environmental change and intensifying conflicts between humans and predators, effective study designs integrating electronic tagging to study predation have a promising future in fundamental and applied ecology.</jats:p>

AB  - In Norway, willow (Lagopus lagopus) and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) populations and harvests have declined during the last few decades, and the 2 species are considered as near threatened on the Norwegian Red List. The Norwegian State-Owned Land and Forest Enterprise (Statskog) is a main provider of ptarmigan hunting on public lands, and has recently introduced harvest restrictions in Nordland County. We investigated the relationship between hunters’ opinions and the effects of restrictions on hunters and ptarmigan harvest using online structured questionnaires (2012, n = 570) and bag reports (2009–2011, n = 8,795). A majority of hunters (66%) supported harvest restrictions, and 89% were willing to shoot fewer birds to increase population size. However, opinions towards specific management alternatives were more negative and disparate. Residency of the hunters (local or non-resident) was the most influential factor on hunter opinions, and this reflected a tendency to approve of restrictions with the smallest effect on their own hunting practice. Our study indicates that access and the opportunity to hunt are more important to hunters than bag size. Daily and annual hunting bags were small, averaging 1.7 and 5.8 ptarmigan, respectively, and the daily bag limit of 4 birds was reached during 5.8% of hunting days. A harvest reduction of 50% implied a daily bag limit of 1 bird and a seasonal bag of 4, which were lower than what hunters found as acceptable. Hence, although hunter opinions may provide useful guidelines for the development of management practices, their opinions need to be evaluated for the actual effects they may have on the game populations. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - 1. Sustainable harvest management implies an ability to control harvest rates. This is challenging in systems that have limited control of resources and resource users, which is often the case in small game harvest management. The difference between management strategies and actual harvest bag size (i.e. implementation uncertainty) may be substantial, but few studies have explored this.     2. We investigated how different management strategies and ecosystem variables affected realised harvest of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) among nine independently-managed, state-owned hunting areas in Central and South Norway during 2008-2015. First, we focused our empirical analysis around three response variables of interest: hunting bag (scaled by area), hunting effort (number of hunting days scaled by area) and hunter efficiency (shot birds per hunting day). Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) guided model selection among candidate GLMMs. Then, we used model-averaged parameter estimating from the statistical models in numerical simulations to explore risk of overharvest due to implementation uncertainty.     3. The most parsimonious model explaining hunting bag included total allowable catch (TAC) and willow ptarmigan density. Hunting effort was explained by number of permits sold and type of quota (daily vs. weekly quota). The most parsimonious model describing hunter efficiency only included the effect of willow ptarmigan density.     4. Our results show that managers have only partial control over harvest rates in this system, and that hunters were relatively more efficient and harvest rates higher at low densities. This effect was present for all management strategy scenarios, including when managers adjusted TAC according to population estimates from monitoring programs.     5. Synthesis and applications. Quantifying risk of unsustainable harvest rates under different scenarios enables managers to make informed decisions, when dealing with competing objectives of harvest opportunities and sustainability. The substantial risk of high harvest rates at low densities reported here should encourage frequent use of threshold strategies. This study is one of the first approaches for quantifying implementation uncertainty in small game harvest, and shows how estimates from empirical analyses could be used to quantify risk of overharvest.

AB  - Change in the size of populations over space and time is, arguably, the motivation for much of pure and applied ecological research. The fundamental model for the dynamics of any population is straightforward: the net change in the abundance is the simple difference between the number of individuals entering the population and the number leaving the population, either or both of which may change in response to factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the population. While harvest of individuals from a population constitutes a clear extrinsic source of removal of individuals, the response of populations to harvest is frequently complex, reflecting an interaction of harvest with one or more population processes. Here we consider the role of these interactions, and factors influencing them, on the effective harvest management of waterfowl populations. We review historical ideas concerning harvest and discuss the relationship(s) between waterfowl life histories and the development and application of population models to inform harvest management. The influence of population structure (age, spatial) on derivation of optimal harvest strategies (with and without explicit consideration of various sources of uncertainty) is considered. In addition to population structure, we discuss how the optimal harvest strategy may be influenced by: 1) patterns of density-dependence in one or more vital rates, and 2) heterogeneity in vital rates among individuals within an age-sex-size class. Although derivation of the optimal harvest strategy for simple population models (with or without structure) is generally straightforward, there are several potential difficulties in application. In particular, uncertainty concerning the population structure at the time of harvest, and the ability to regulate the structure of the harvest itself, are significant complications. We therefore review the evidence of effects of harvest on waterfowl populations. Some

AB  - The Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.) is a grouse species of open boreal or high altitude forests of Eurasia. It is endangered throughout most mountain range habitat areas in Europe. Two major genetically identifiable lineages of Western Capercaillie have been described to date: the southern lineage at the species' southernmost range of distribution in Europe, and the boreal lineage. We address the question of genetic differentiation of capercaillie populations from the Rhodope and Rila Mountains in Bulgaria, across the Dinaric Mountains to the Slovenian Alps. The two lineages' contact zone and resulting conservation strategies in this so-far understudied area of distribution have not been previously determined. The results of analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences of 319 samples from the studied populations show that Alpine populations were composed exclusively of boreal lineage; Dinaric populations of both, but predominantly (96%) of boreal lineage; and Rhodope-Rila populations predominantly (>90%) of southern lineage individuals. The Bulgarian mountains were identified as the core area of the southern lineage, and the Dinaric Mountains as the western contact zone between both lineages in the Balkans. Bulgarian populations appeared genetically distinct from Alpine and Dinaric populations and exhibited characteristics of a long-term stationary population, suggesting that they should be considered as a glacial relict and probably a distinct subspecies. Although all of the studied populations suffered a decline in the past, the significantly lower level of genetic diversity when compared with the neighbouring Alpine and Bulgarian populations suggests that the isolated Dinaric capercaillie is particularly vulnerable to continuing population decline. The results are discussed in the context of conservation of the species in the Balkans, its principal threats and legal protection status. Potential conservation strategies should consider the existence of the two lineages and their vulnerable Dinaric contact zone and support the specificities of the populations.

AB  - One of the central goals of the field of population ecology is to identify the drivers of population dynamics, particularly in the context of predator-prey relationships. Understanding the relative role of top-down versus bottom-up drivers is of particular interest in understanding ecosystem dynamics. Our goal was to explore predator-prey relationships in a boreal ecosystem in interior Alaska through the use of multispecies long-term monitoring data. We used 29 years of field data and a dynamic multistate site occupancy modeling approach to explore the trophic relationships between an apex predator, the golden eagle, and cyclic populations of the two primary prey species available to eagles early in the breeding season, snowshoe hare and willow ptarmigan. We found that golden eagle reproductive success was reliant on prey numbers, but also responded prior to changes in the phase of the snowshoe hare population cycle and failed to respond to variation in hare cycle amplitude. There was no lagged response to ptarmigan populations, and ptarmigan populations recovered quickly from the low phase. Together, these results suggested that eagle reproduction is largely driven by bottom-up processes, with little evidence of top-down control of either ptarmigan or hare populations. Although the relationship between golden eagle reproductive success and prey abundance had been previously established, here we established prey populations are likely driving eagle dynamics through bottom-up processes. The key to this insight was our focus on golden eagle reproductive parameters rather than overall abundance. Although our inference is limited to the golden eagle-hare-ptarmigan relationships we studied, our results suggest caution in interpreting predator-prey abundance patterns among other species as strong evidence for top-down control.

AB  - Summary 1. The potential effects of wind energy development on wildlife have received increased attention over the past decade. In Kansas, optimal sites for wind energy development often overlap with preferred habitats of greater prairie-chickens Tympanuchus cupido. Our goal was to determine whether wind energy development affected survival of female prairie-chickens in a grassland ecosystem, assessing one potential impact of wind on an upland gamebird of conservation concern. We focused primarily on the response of female prairie-chickens to wind energy development because population dynamics of prairie-chickens are primarily determined by female demography. 2. We monitored prairie-chickens at a wind facility in Kansas during a 2-year pre-construction (2007–2008) and a 3-year post-construction period (2009–2011). We used data from 220 radio-marked females to calculate weekly survival and hazard rates. We used cause of death for 81 mortality events to test for changes in the proportion of mortalities attributed to mammalian predators, avian predators and collisions. 3. We observed an unexpected increase in annual survival during the post-construction period (057) compared with the pre-construction period (032). Distance from home range centroid to the nearest wind turbine site had no effect on weekly survival of females. Collision mortality events were rare, and most were associated with fences or transmission lines and not turbine blades. 4. Most female mortality was due to predation (c. 90%). Differences in annual survival were driven by a higher risk of mortality during lekking activity in March and April during the preconstruction period (weekly hazard rate = 0050–0062) compared with the post-construction period (hazard rate = 0012–0021). We observed no change in the proportion of mortalities attributed to different causes between the two treatment periods. 5. Synthesis and applications. Development of a wind energy facility had no negative effect on survival of female prairie-chickens. The results of our field study indicate that greater prairie-chickens are less sensitive to wind energy development than lesser prairie-chickens Tympanuchus pallidicinctus and greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus are to oil and gas development. We have strong evidence that survival increased after wind energy development, and hypothesize that energy development affected the local predator community, resulting in an indirect effect of decreased predation risk during the post-construction period.

AB  - In the Canton of Ticino in southern Switzerland data from the monitoring programme for black grouse from 1981 to 2016 (population density, lek size, sex ratio in chicks and adults) were analysed together with information on bag statistics and hunting regulations to evaluate if mortality from hunting had an additive effect. In the study population the proportion of cocks at the beginning of the study period was only 23%. As hunting regulations for black grouse were tightened in the late 1970s the observed proportion of males showed an increase in particular during the first years but remained much lower than what would be expected from the sex ratio among chicks assuming equal survival between the sexes. The observed low proportion of adult males indicates a lower survival rate and as a consequence a smaller than natural lek size. High reproductive success two years before had a positive effect on lek size. The correlation coefficient between hunting bag and population size index increased with increasing hunting pressure and showed a decline over the years. Bag size in the period with a high hunting pressure (1981–1999, many hunting days) was driven by population density whereas in the second period (2000–2016, few hunting days) it was driven by hunting regulations. Our analysis showed that hunting affects population structure and presents indirect evidence that mortality due to hunting is additive. The study also shows that hunting management has to be continuously adapted to changes in the size and structure of the population as well as changes in habitat conditions. It is therefore essential to continue long-term monitoring of population size and of demographic parameters.

Population responses to extrinsic mortality can yield no change in number of survivors (compensation) or an increase in number of survivors (overcompensation) when the population is regulated by negative density-dependence. This intriguing response has been the subject of theoretical studies, but few experiments have explored how the source of extrinsic mortality affects the response. 2. This study tests abilities of three functionally diverse predators, alone and combined, to induce (over)compensation of a prey population. Larval Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) were exposed to predation by Mesocyclops longisetus (Crustacea: Copepoda), Anopheles barberi (Diptera: Culicidae), Corethrella appendiculata (Diptera: Corethrellidae), all three in a substitutive design, or no predation. 3. The number of survivors to adulthood, female size and development time, and a composite index of performance (r') were analysed. Predator treatment did not have a significant effect on total number of survivors, nor on number of males, suggesting mortality by predation was compensatory. Predation significantly affected number of female survivors, with a trend of more females produced with predation, though no post hoc tests were significant. Predation significantly increased female development rate and r' relative to no-predator control. 4. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the change in the number of female adults produced was the largest contributing factor to the differences in r' among cohorts. While predation did not significantly increase overall production of adults, it did release survivors from density-dependent effects sufficiently to increase population performance. This study provides an empirical test of mechanisms by which predation may yield positive effects on a population of victims, a phenomenon predicted to occur across many taxa and food webs.

AB  - Hunter harvest is a potential factor contributing to population declines of sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.). As a result, wildlife agencies throughout western North America have set increasingly more conservative harvest regulations over the past 25 years to reduce or eliminate hunter success and concomitant numbers of harvested greater (C. urophasianus) and Gunnison (C. minimus) sage-grouse. Sage-grouse hunting has varied widely over time and space, which has made a comprehensive summary of hunting management challenging. We compiled data on harvest regulations among 11 western U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces from 1870-2019 to create a timeline representative of hunting regulations. We compared annual harvest boundaries and area-weighted average hunting regulations, 1995-2018, relative to administrative boundaries and areas of high probability of sage-grouse occupation. We also summarized estimated numbers of birds harvested and hunters afield, 1995-2018, across both species' ranges. From 1995-2018, there was a 30% reduction in administrative harvest boundaries across the greater sage-grouse range compared to a 16.6% reduction in area open to harvest within 8 km from active leks. Temporary closures occurred in response to wildfires, disease outbreaks, low population numbers, and two research projects; whereas, permanent closures primarily occurred in small populations and areas on the periphery of the species distribution. Similarly, area-weighted possession limits and season length for greater sage-grouse decreased 52.6% and 61.0%, respectively, while season start date stayed relatively stable (mean start date ~259 [mid-September]). In contrast, hunting of the now federally-threatened Gunnison sage-grouse ended after 1999. While restrictions in harvest regulations were large in area, closures near areas of high greater sage-grouse occupancy were relatively smaller with the same trend for Gunnison sage-grouse until hunting ceased. For greater sage-grouse, most states reduced bag and possession limits and appeared to adhere to recommendations for later and shorter hunting seasons, reducing potential for additive mortality.

AB  - Hunting is a major threat to many species of wildlife. However, managing hunting systems to ensure their sustainability requires a thorough demographic knowledge about the impact of hunting. Here we develop a framework integrating ecological, modelling and sociological data to achieve a sustainability assessment of flying-fox hunting in New Caledonia and assess the relative merits of alternative management policies. Using age-specific stochastic population models, we found that the current annual hunting rate [5.5-8.5%] is likely to lead to a severe decline (- 79%) of Pteropus populations over the next 30 years. However, a majority of hunters surveyed (60%) were willing to soften their practices, offering an opportunity for adaptive management. Recurrent temporary hunting ban (at least 1 year out of 2) in combination with protected areas (≥ 25%) appears as the most effective and most accepted management option. Our integrative approach appears to be a promising method for ensuring that traditional hunting systems can remain sustainable in a rapidly changing world.

AB  - Summary     Density dependence regulates populations of many species across all taxonomic groups. Understanding density dependence is vital for predicting the effects of climate, habitat loss and/or management actions on wild populations. Migratory species likely experience seasonal changes in the relative influence of density dependence on population processes such as survival and recruitment throughout the annual cycle. These effects must be accounted for when characterizing migratory populations via population models.     To evaluate effects of density on seasonal survival and recruitment of a migratory species, we used an existing full annual cycle model framework for American black ducks Anas rubripes, and tested different density effects (including no effects) on survival and recruitment. We then used a Bayesian model weight updating routine to determine which population model best fit observed breeding population survey data between 1990 and 2014.     The models that best fit the survey data suggested that survival and recruitment were affected by density dependence and that density effects were stronger on adult survival during the breeding season than during the non-breeding season.     Analysis also suggests that regulation of survival and recruitment by density varied over time. Our results showed that different characterizations of density regulations changed every 8–12 years (three times in the 25-year period) for our population.     Synthesis and applications. Using a full annual cycle, modelling framework and model weighting routine will be helpful in evaluating density dependence for migratory species in both the short and long term. We used this method to disentangle the seasonal effects of density on the continental American black duck population which will allow managers to better evaluate the effects of habitat loss and potential habitat management actions throughout the annual cycle. The method here may allow researchers to hone in on the proper form and/or strength of density dependence for use in models for conservation recommendations.

AB  - Summary 1. The population dynamic and evolutionary effects of harvesting are receiving growing attention among biologists. Cause-specific estimates of mortality are necessary to determine and compare the magnitude and selectivity of hunting and other types of mortalities. In addition to the logistic and financial constraints on longitudinal studies, they are complicated by the fact that nonhunting mortality in managed populations usually consists of a mix of natural and human-caused factors. 2. We used multistate capture‐recapture (MCR) models to estimate cause-specific survival of brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) in two subpopulations in Sweden over a 23-year period. In our analysis, we distinguished between legal hunting and other sources of mortality, such as intraspecific predation, accidents, poaching, and damage control removals. We also tested whether a strong increase in harvest quotas after 1997 in one of the subpopulations affected vulnerability to legal hunting. 3. Although only a fraction of mortalities other than legal hunting could be considered natural, this group of causes showed a general pattern of demographic selectivity expected from natural mortality regimes in populations of long-lived species, namely greater vulnerability of young animals. On the other hand, demographic effects on hunting vulnerability were weak and inconsistent. Our findings support the assumption that hunting and other mortalities were additive. 4. As expected, an increase in hunting pressure coincided with a correspondingly large increase in vulnerability to hunting in the affected subpopulation. Because even unbiased harvest can lead to selective pressures on life-history traits, such as size at primiparity, increasing harvest quotas may not only affect population growth directly, but could also alter optimal life-history strategies in brown bears and other carnivores. 5. Legal hunting is the most conveniently assessed and the most easily managed cause of mortality in many wild populations of large mammals. Although legal hunting is the single-most important cause of mortality for brown bears in Sweden, the combined mortality from other causes is of considerable magnitude and additionally shows greater selectivity in terms of sex and age than legal hunting. Therefore, its role in population dynamics and evolution should not be underestimated.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Waterbirds are particularly affected by the high hunting pressure they face in many regions, which in some cases is compromising conservation actions for threatened species. The marbled teal <jats:italic>Marmaronetta angustirostris</jats:italic> is one of the most endangered waterbirds in Europe. In order to restore its population, several conservation actions have recently been undertaken, including a population reinforcement programme in Spain using captive‐bred birds. With the aim of assessing the success of the reinforcement programme to establish a long‐term self‐sustaining population, we identified mortality causes of marbled teal, evaluated the survival of individual birds of the reinforcement programme and estimated the viability of the population under different management scenarios. We used data from wild and captive‐bred individuals tracked by GPS since 2018 (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 42) and from a mark–recapture programme initiated in 2015 (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 297). We recovered 15 dead birds or transmitters: 20% died of natural causes, 60% of non‐natural causes (including all anthropic causes) and 20% of unknown causes. Furthermore, the GPS tags of 24 birds unexpectedly stopped transmitting without any indication of malfunction, and for 66.7% of these disappeared birds, the cessation was suspected to be caused by illegal shooting. Survival during the hunting season was higher for males (31.3%) than for females (12.5%), and for the wild (50%) than for the captive‐bred birds (9.4%), probably due to differences in migration patterns to North Africa. Population viability models revealed that maintaining the breeding population at the current mortality rates is only possible with a permanent release programme of captive‐bred individuals, and that in order to establish a self‐sustaining population, non‐natural mortality would have to be reduced by at least 40%. We recommend management measures to reduce marbled teal mortality, such as limiting legal hunting to hours with clear visibility, prosecuting illegal shootings, controlling exotic predators and improving water management to reduce disease outbreaks. Some improvements can be implemented in captive‐breeding programmes, such as earlier release times and incorporating anti‐predator training.</jats:p>

AB  - Extrinsic mortality impinging on negatively density-dependent populations can result in no change in the number of survivors (compensation) or an increase (overcompensation) by releasing the population from density-dependent effects on survivorship. The relationship between the level of extrinsic mortality (i.e., percentage of mortality) and the level and likelihood of overcompensation is theoretically important, but rarely investigated. We tested the hypothesis that overcompensation occurs below a threshold value of extrinsic mortality that is related to density-dependent mortality rate, and that additive extrinsic mortality occurs above this threshold. This hypothesis predicts that survivorship vs. extrinsic mortality will: 1) be best described by a two-segmented model with a threshold; 2) have a slope >0 below the threshold; and 3) have a slope=-1 above the threshold. We also tested whether mortality imposed by real predators and random harvest have equivalent effects on adult production, and whether magnitude of overcompensation is related to species sensitivity to density-dependence. These hypotheses were tested in the container mosquitoes Aedes aegypti, A. albopictus, A. triseriatus, and Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae). Cohorts of 150 larvae were exposed to random harvest of 0-70% two days after hatch or to predation by 1-3 Mesocyclops longisetus (Crustacea: Copepoda). Overcompensation occurred in A. aegypti in a pattern consistent with predictions. Aedes triseriatus showed strong overcompensation but no evidence of a threshold, whereas A. albopictus and C. pipiens had survival consistent with compensatory mortality but no evidence of a threshold. Compared to random harvest, mortality from predation yielded greater adult production in A. aegypti and A. albopictus, lesser adult production in C. pipiens, and no difference in adult production in A. triseriatus. Our results are largely consistent with our hypothesis about overcompensation, with the caveat that thresholds for additive mortality appear to occur at very high levels of extrinsic mortality. Magnitudes of overcompensation for the three Aedes were inversely related to survival in the 0% mortality treatment, consistent with our hypothesis that overcompensation is related to sensitivity to density-dependence. A broad range of extrinsic mortality levels can yield overcompensation, which may have practical implications for attempts to control pest populations.

AB  - Understanding the influence of harvest regulations on wildlife populations is crucial for successful population management and species conservation. This is true of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of great conservation concern in western North America that is a candidate for protection under the United States Endangered Species Act and is hunted in nine states within the United States. Recent recommendations have proposed shifting hunting seasons to later in the year, with a goal of reducing harvest of adult female and juvenile sage-grouse. Foundational principles of harvest theory, however, suggest that such changes to harvest timing could have unintentional and adverse effects on greater sage-grouse populations. I used published estimates of seasonal survival to reconstruct weekly mortality curves for adult female and juvenile greater sage-grouse in Nevada, USA. Under a hypothesis of compensatory mortality, I then calculated the maximum harvest occurring during any 1-week interval that could be compensated by non-harvest mortality that occurs after the hunting season. This value universally declines as harvest is held later in the season. Under a hypothesis of additive mortality, I calculated the realized reductions in both survival and subsequent reproductive success that would be expected for a given level of harvest. Both of these values increase if harvest is conducted later in the season, resulting in a larger additive effect than if harvest had occurred earlier. If reduced mortality of specific age or sex classes is desired, I suggest managers employ reduced bag limits, shortened season lengths, or permit systems to meet this objective. Holding hunting seasons later in the year than is presently custom (i.e., beginning sometime during Sep) should be avoided unless specific information exists to predict the change in harvest rate that would occur following changes to harvest timing. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, Clem., is the most significant defoliating pest of boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and spruce (Picea sp.) in North America. Historically, spruce budworm outbreaks have been managed via a reactive, foliage protection approach focused on keeping trees alive rather than stopping the outbreak. However, recent theoretical and technical advances have renewed interest in proactive population control to reduce outbreak spread and magnitude, i.e., the Early Intervention Strategy (EIS). In essence, EIS is an area-wide management program premised on detecting and controlling rising spruce budworm populations (hotspots) along the leading edge of an outbreak. In this article, we lay out the conceptual framework for EIS, including all of the core components needed for such a program to be viable. We outline the competing hypotheses of spruce budworm population dynamics and discuss their implications for how we manage outbreaks. We also discuss the practical needs for such a program to be successful (e.g., hotspot monitoring, population control, and cost–benefit analyses), as well as the importance of proactive communications with stakeholders.

AB  - Population manipulation of introduced species can be difficult and many widespread eradication or reduction attempts have failed. Understanding the population dynamics of a species is essential for undertaking a successful control program. Despite this, control attempts are frequently undertaken with limited knowledge of the species population dynamics. For example, in Australia, concern over the impact of the introduced common myna (Acridotheres tristis) has led to community members culling the species. In this paper, we assessed the impact of community-led common myna culling program over broad and fine-scales in Canberra, Australia. We utilized a basic population model to enhance understanding of common myna population dynamics and the potential influence of various culling regimes. We found a significant negative relationship between common myna abundance and culling at fine-scales (1 km2). However, over broad-scales the relationship between common myna abundance and culling was not significant. Our population model indicated culling at a rate of 25 birds per km2 per year would reduce common myna abundance, regardless of initial density. Our results suggest that currently too few individuals are being removed from the Canberra population, and natural reproduction, survival and/or immigration is able to replace the culled individuals. This highlights the value of undertaking basic population modeling to assess if potential control measures are capable of achieving desired outcomes. Our work provides information for researchers, government and community groups interested in controlling not only the common myna, but also other introduced species.

AB  - Annual variation in harvested animals (hereafter bag size) is often used as an index of population abundance when investigating population dynamics. Few studies have evaluated how well bag size tracks population change despite its widespread use. Two recent studies on grouse harvest statistics have reached contrasting conclusions. Th ere is limited information about the functional response of hunters in relation to varying game densities, and effort is seldom recorded. We investigated how much of the variation in bag size (total number of harvested grouse km−2) is explained by variation in willow grouse Lagopus lagopus density (adult and young grouse km−2) and hunting eff ort (total number of hunting days km−2). We also evaluated catch per unit effort (CPUE) as an index of grouse abundance, and estimated the response in harvest rate (total bag size in relation to total grouse density) to varying hunting effort. We used data from the 88 management areas on state land in Jamtland county, Sweden (1996–2007), where hunting days and bag size are recorded in detail. Willow grouse density was estimated in four of these management areas in August using line transects and distance sampling. The hunting effort and total grouse density explained most of the variation in bag size (R2= 0.89). Bag size was twice as sensitive to changes in hunting effort compared to changes in grouse density. More than a ten times change in the grouse population density was required to one unit change in bag size. The use of CPUE did not provide a better alternative index of grouse density, and variation in density only explained 23% of the variation in CPUE. Harvest rate showed a strong relationship with hunting effort, and we suggest that an upper limit in hunting effort can be used to reduce the risk of high harvest rates. Hunters became more efficient at low densities and controlling hunting effort is most important when there are indications of population lows and/or poor breeding. CPUE may be less sensitive to changes in game abundance than previously assumed, and bag size as a proxy for population density would then depend on the ability of hunters to adjust their effort according to population change. We speculate that this ability will depend on whether or not hunters have long-term experience of a hunting area where they can return to hunt throughout the hunting season. We propose that recording hunting eff ort should be encouraged and possible correlations with game abundance and other factors such as weather should be investigated for game species.

AB  - The British countryside is renowned for its pastoral beauty: a rich mosaic of farmland, woodlands, hedgerows and winding lanes where biodiversity flourishes. Yet linger within this apparently serene landscape and you are likely to discover an equally rich mosaic of conflict, which can sometimes be bitter and acrimonious. We see conflicts emerge over a wide range of issues, such as the culling of badgers Meles meles to control disease in cattle, the impact of intensive farming techniques on biodiversity or the illegal killing of predators for the benefit of game species. As we see elsewhere in this book, such conflicts are not restricted to the UK; they occur worldwide. Conflicts differ in details and participants, but they are often similar in challenges and strategies for resolution. Ecological arguments invariably are part of conservation conflicts. We need to understand what impacts our activities have on species and ecosystems. Typically, in conflicts, the information deficit model is followed (Burgess et al ., 1998). This model holds that more expert knowledge (in our case ecological data) and better communication are needed to help raise awareness, develop effective policies and change people's behaviour. Ecology is therefore often seen as providing the necessary objective evidence to enable decisions to be made to address conservation conflict. Consider, for example, the situation of conflicts involving predators. Those whose livelihoods depend on prey species commonly perceive predators as threats. So, ecologists commonly ask if perceptions of impact match ecological data (Sillero-Zubiri et al ., 2007; Dickman, 2010). To make a decision about predator management, we need to quantify predation levels, understand how predation varies in time and space and how predators impact prey populations. Once we understand these ecological interactions and impacts, we can then make predictions about when and where different interests may become incompatible and to initiate management decisions. Frequently there may be several different techniques available for reducing impact so we need to know the relative effectiveness of each (Smith et al ., 2014). Ecological data and analysis can help us distinguish between the effectiveness of alternative management strategies (see Box 9).

AB  - Large-scale multi-species data on population changes of alpine or arctic species are largely lacking. At the same time, climate change has been argued to cause poleward and uphill range shifts and the concomitant predicted loss of habitat may have drastic eff ects on alpine and arctic species. Here we present a multi-national bird indicator for the Fennoscandian mountain range in northern Europe (Finland, Sweden and Norway), based on 14 common species of montane tundra and subalpine birch forest. Th e data were collected at 262 alpine survey plots, mainly as a part of geographically representative national breeding bird monitoring schemes. Th e area sampled covers around 1/4 million km 2 , spanning 10 degrees of latitude and 1600 km in a northeast – southwest direction. During 2002 – 2012, nine of the 14 bird species declined signifi cantly in numbers, in parallel to higher summer temperatures and precipitation during this period compared to the preceding 40 yr. Th e population trends were largely parallel in the three countries and similar among montane tundra and subalpine birch forest species. Long-distance migrants declined less on average than residents and short-distance migrants. Some potential causes of the current decline of alpine birds are discussed, but since montane bird population sizes may show strong natural annual variation due to several factors, longer time series are needed to verify the observed population trends. Th e present Fennoscandian monitoring systems, which from 2010 onwards include more than 400 montane survey plots, have the capacity to deliver a robust bird indicator in the climate-sensitive mountainous regions of northernmost Europe for conservation purposes.

AB  - Whether anthropogenic mortality is additive or compensatory to natural mortality in animal populations has long been a question of theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, under density-dependent conditions populations compensate for anthropogenic mortality through decreases in natural mortality and/or increases in productivity, but recent studies of large carnivores suggest that anthropogenic mortality can be fully additive to natural mortality and thereby constrain annual survival and population growth rate. Nevertheless, mechanisms underlying either compensatory or additive effects continue to be poorly understood. Using long-term data on a reintroduced population of the red wolf, we tested for evidence of additive vs. compensatory effects of anthropogenic mortality on annual survival and population growth rates, and the preservation and reproductive success of breeding pairs. We found that anthropogenic mortality had a strong additive effect on annual survival and population growth rate at low population density, though there was evidence for compensation in population growth at high density. When involving the death of a breeder, anthropogenic mortality was also additive to natural rates of breeding pair dissolution, resulting in a net decrease in the annual preservation of existing breeding pairs. However, though the disbanding of a pack following death of a breeder resulted in fewer recruits per litter relative to stable packs, there was no relationship between natural rates of pair dissolution and population growth rate at either high or low density. Thus we propose that short-term additive effects of anthropogenic mortality on population growth in the red wolf population at low density were primarily a result of direct mortality of adults rather than indirect socially-mediated effects resulting in reduced recruitment. Finally, we also demonstrate that per capita recruitment and the proportion of adults that became reproductive declined steeply with increasing population density, suggesting that there is potential for density-dependent compensation of anthropogenically-mediated population regulation.

AB  - INRODUCTION This special feature of Avian Conservation and Ecology contains a Special Issue of ten articles describing extent and character of avian mortality in Canada associated with human activities. These include estimates of mortality resulting from mowing and other mechanical operations, industrial forestry, domestic cats, collisions with windows, wind turbines, power lines and vehicles, bycatch in commercial fisheries, and both offshore and terrestrial oil and gas exploration and production. These articles contain sector-based assessments of the annual magnitude of the number of eggs or active nests destroyed and number of birds killed as a consequence of a wide range of human activities, excluding habitat development and hunting. This Special Issue represents an unprecedented snapshot of the state of knowledge for such sources of mortality for an entire country at a specific time. Needless to say, numbers of such avian mortalities that can be attributed to humans are large and unevenly distributed among species and different activities.

AB  - Hunter harvest of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter "sage-grouse") has been regulated by wildlife agencies during most of the past century. Hunting season regulations were maintained with the intention of providing sustainable hunting opportunities. Sage-grouse populations oscillate over time, and population growth can be influenced by seasonal weather and habitat disturbance. From 1995-2013, we compared sage-grouse lek trends from 22 relatively distinct sage-grouse population segments in 9 western U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces. We stratified these populations into 3 broad categories (non-hunted [n = 8], continuously hunted [n = 10], and hunting season discontinued between 1996-2003 [n = 4]) with 8 different regulation histories to evaluate the potential impact of harvest on sage-grouse populations. Concomitantly, we assessed the effects of proportion burned, forested and cropland habitat; winter, spring, and summer precipitation; and human population, road, and oil and gas well densities on initial and time-varying lek counts. Density-dependent models fit lek trend data best for all regulation histories. In general, higher proportions of burnt, forested, and cropland habitat; and greater human population and oil and gas well densities were associated with lower equilibrium abundance (K). We found mixed results regarding the effect of hunting regulations on instantaneous growth rate (r). The cessation of harvest from 1996-2001 in approximately half of the largest sage-grouse population in our analysis was associated with higher r. Continuously harvested sage-grouse populations with permit hunting seasons had higher r during years with higher proportion of area exposed to permitted hunting rather than general upland game seasons. However, more liberal hunting regulations were positively associated with higher r in populations continuously harvested under general upland game hunts. Our results suggest that discontinuing harvest in the largest population resulted in greater population growth rates; however, this was not consistently the case for smaller populations. To no surprise, not all sage-grouse populations were influenced by the same environmental change or human disturbance factors. Our results will assist managers to understand factors associated with K, which provides the best targets for conservation efforts.

AB  - In the period following wolf (Canis lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park (1995-2004), the northern Yellowstone elk (Gervus elaphus) herd declined from - 17 000 to ∼8000 elk (8.1% yr -1 ). The extent to which wolf predation contributed to this decline is not obvious because the influence of other factors (human harvest and lower than average annual rainfall) on elk dynamics has not been quantified. To assess the contribution of wolf predation to this elk decline, we built and assessed models based on elk-related data prior to wolf reintroduction (1961 to 1995). We then used the best of these models to predict how elk dynamics might have been realized after wolf reintroduction (1995 to 2004) had wolves never been reintroduced. The best performing model predicted 64% of the variance in growth rate and included elk abundance, harvest rate. annual snowfall, and annual precipitation as predictor variables. The best performing models also suggest that harvest may be super-additive. That is, for every one percent increase in harvest rate, elk population growth rate declines by more than one percent. Harvest rate also accounted for ∼47% of the observed variation in elk growth rate. According to the best-performing model, which accounts for harvest rate and climate, the elk population would have been expected to decline by 7.9% per year, on average, between 1995 and 2004. Within the limits of uncertainty, which are not trivial, climate and harvest rate are justified explanations for most of the observed elk decline. To the extent that this is true, we suggest that between 1995 and 2004 wolf predation was primarily compensatory.

AB  - Willow ptarmigan is a popular game species for recreational hunting purpose throughout its range and long term harvest statistics are available for many areas. For the State owned land in Sweden hunting report rates are unusually high and provide a high level of information, including hunting effort, making this a unique dataset. In easy accessible hunting areas hunting pressure commonly is high, making monitoring and managing populations necessary. During this study harvest data from all hunting areas within the County of Jamtland and population estimates from four long term monitoring areas from the County of Jamtland, Sweden, from 1996 – 2010 were analysed. The aim of this study was to develop methods to predict the success of hunters based on previous years harvest data and results from the yearly ptarmigan counts prior to the start of the hunting season, to avoid over-harvesting. Further a method to calculate the amount of hunting possible to achieve a defined harvest level was developed. And last, a set of management options to reduce hunting pressure were assessed. Adult density, proportion of successfully reproducing adults and average brood size explained most of the variance within bag size (Radj. = 0.72). CPUE did not differ over time (p=0.12) and area (p=0.12) and allowed to calculate amount of hunting possible to achieve certain harvest rate. Observed amount of hunting was lower than the hunting limit in most cases. Excluding foreign hunters can reduce total harvest up to 40% (2008/2009) while reducing bag limit and shortening the hunting season will have a marginal effect on harvest. . I suggest using adult density, proportion of successfully reproducing adults and average brood size to determine harvest levels rather than overall density. Calculating hunting levels should be done by using a fixed CPUE value which takes local fluctuations into account and allows a certain amount of hunting every year. I suggest that the reporting system for hunting results is revised so the effective amount of hunting can be calculated and used for management decisions.

AB  - Birds colliding with turbine rotor blades is a well-known negative consequence of wind-power plants. However, there has been far less attention to the risk of birds colliding with the turbine towers, and how to mitigate this risk.Based on data from the Smola wind-power plant in Central Norway, it seems highly likely that willow ptarmigan (the only gallinaceous species found on the island) is prone to collide with turbine towers. By employing a BACI-approach, we tested if painting the lower parts of turbine towers black would reduce the collision risk.Overall, there was a 48% reduction in the number of recorded ptarmigan carcasses per search at painted turbines relative to neighboring control (unpainted) ones, with significant variation both within and between years.Using contrast painting to the turbine towers resulted in significantly reduced number of ptarmigan carcasses found, emphasizing the effectiveness of such a relatively simple mitigation measure.

AB  - Abstract Recent examinations of hunting’s impact on populations of long-lived species illustrate the rarity of strong compensatory responses. The extent to which sandhill crane populations exhibit compensatory, partially compensatory, or additive responses to harvest mortality is poorly known. To examine how sandhill crane harvests might impact resident, breeding crane populations, we simulated harvests of a well-studied population of individually marked birds at varying harvest intensities and degrees of selectivity within the social structure of territorial and non-territorial cranes. Simulations occurred in a demographically-explicit stochastic population model developed from a previous long-term (2000–2014) study of a sandhill crane population at carrying capacity in southcentral Wisconsin, USA. Non-selective harvest models that did not account for reproductive lags after territorial birds replaced lost mates produced additive responses and resulted in declining populations when ≥ 7% of the population was harvested annually. When models of non-selective harvest incorporated reproductive lags, this threshold was reduced to ≥ 5%. Harvesting at or above 5% harvest intensities continuously decreased population size over a 100-year period. In all models of selective harvests, when only non-territorial birds were harvested, all populations returned to equilibrium. Population responses to harvest are sensitive to the number of territorial birds harvested, and this sensitivity increases when accounting for lags in reproduction stemming from mortality-induced mate replacement. If possible, limiting harvest of territorial birds from any one specific population would help maintain stability of populations when implementing a hunt. This study provides evidence for harvest impacts at a localized scale, and it represents an important first step toward better understanding the potential impacts of hunting on population responses at a regional scale, especially where resident, territorial birds might be harvested.

AB  - Survival is a key demographic component that often varies as a result of human activities such as recreational harvest. Detailed understanding of seasonal variation in mortality patterns and the role of various risk factors is thus crucial for understanding the link between environmental variation and wildlife population dynamics and to design sustainable harvest management systems. Here, we report from a detailed seasonal and cause-specific decomposition of mortality risks in willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in central Norway. The analyses are based on radio-collared (n = 188) birds that were monitored across all seasons, and we used time-to-event models for competing risks to estimate mortality patterns. Overall, annual survival was estimated at 0.43 (SE: 0.04), with no distinct difference among years (2015/16 to 2018/19) or between sexes. Analysis of mortality risk factors revealed that on the annual basis, the risk of harvest mortality was lower than the risk of dying from natural causes. However, during the autumn harvest season (September-November), survival was low and the dominating cause of mortality was harvest. During winter (December-March) and spring seasons (April-May), survival was in general high and did not vary between males and females. However, during the spring season, juveniles (i.e., birds born last year) of both sexes had lower survival than adults, potentially because they are more prone to predation. During the summer season (June-August), females experienced a higher hazard than males, underlining the greater parental investment of females during egg production, incubation, and chick rearing compared to males. Our analyses provide unique insight into demographic and seasonal patterns in willow ptarmigan mortality risks in a harvested population and revealed a complex interplay across seasons, risk factors, and demographic classes. Such insight is valuable when designing sustainable management plans in a world undergoing massive environmental perturbations.

AB  - Poder determinar la dispersion y la supervivencia juvenil, desde la emancipacion de los padres hasta su reclutamiento como reproductores, son componentes esenciales de los estudios de dinamica de poblaciones. La dispersion permite la continuidad genetica y la compensacion demografica entre las poblaciones vecinas. Estos problemas son particularmente relevantes para las especies confinadas en las cimas de las montanas, como es el caso del lagopodo alpino en el sur de Europa. Estudiamos la dispersion natal y la supervivencia en juveniles de lagopodo alpino en los Alpes franceses y los Pirineos entre 1999 y 2018 mediante radioseguimiento de 113 jovenes capturados en septiembre entre las dos areas de estudio. En ambas localidades, la dispersion natal se produjo en dos fases discretas, otono (octubre-noviembre) y primavera (finales de marzo-mediados de mayo). Las hembras juveniles se dispersaron dos veces mas que los machos en otono en ambas localidades, pero esta diferencia fue menor en primavera y no significativa. Las distancias de dispersion de los juveniles de ambos sexos fueron mayores en los Pirineos que en los Alpes (machos: 3,5 km versus 1,4 km; hembras: 6,5 km versus 4,4 km), un resultado que nosotros atribuimos a diferencias geneticas, mas que ambientales, entre las dos poblaciones. Respecto al efecto de las barreras geograficas en la dispersion, nuestros datos de telemetria junto con numerosas observaciones sugieren que el lagopodo alpino, tanto en los Alpes como en los Pirineos, raramente cruza valles de 10-12 km de ancho en vuelo directo. Considerando el sexo y las ubicaciones, la tasa de supervivencia de los juveniles de lagopodo alpino durante un periodo de 10 meses (septiembre a junio) es de 0,636 [IC 95%: 0,551-0,734]. Las aves que realizaron movimientos dispersivos mas largos mostraron una tendencia a reducir la supervivencia durante su primer intento de reproduccion (abril-junio), un resultado que sugiere un efecto retardado de dichos movimientos.

AB  - Predator-prey theory predicts that in the presence of multiple types of predators using a common prey, predator facilitation may result as a consequence of contrasting prey defense mechanisms, where reducing the risk from one predator increases the risk from the other. While predator facilitation is well established in natural predator-prey systems, little attention has been paid to situations where human hunters compete with natural predators for the same prey. Here, we investigate hunting-mediated predator facilitation in a hunter-predator-prey system. We found that hunter avoidance by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) exposed them to increase predation risk by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). Lynx responded by increasing their activity and predation on deer, providing evidence that superadditive hunting mortality may be occurring through predator facilitation. Our results reveal a new pathway through which human hunters, in their role as top predators, may affect species interactions at lower trophic levels and thus drive ecosystem processes.

AB  - Effective management of wildlife requires a full understanding of population dynamics and knowledge of potential drivers that influence population growth. The Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) is a popular upland game bird widely distributed across the northern United States and Canada that has experienced population declines within portions of its range in response to forest maturation and habitat loss. Although the species has been extensively studied, few efforts have been made to synthesize demographic data into a sensitivity analysis to guide management actions. We reviewed the literature and compiled Ruffed Grouse vital rates from 14 field studies conducted across four decades (1982–2018) within the Upper Great Lakes region of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, USA. We parameterized a deterministic matrix model to evaluate population dynamics and conducted sensitivity analyses to identify vital rates projected to have the greatest influence on the finite rate of population change (λ). Our modeling effort projected a stable but highly variable annual rate of population change (λ = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.88–1.14) for Ruffed Grouse in the Upper Great Lakes region. Stochastic rates of population change derived from spring drumming surveys (λ = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.61–1.45) and Christmas Bird Count surveys (λ = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.62–1.76) of the corresponding regional population provided validation of stable trends over the same time period as our demographic model. Prospective elasticities and variance-scaled sensitivities suggested λ would be greatly influenced by components of reproductive performance: nesting success, chick survival, and post-fledging juvenile survival. Retrospective analysis indicated that much of the overall variability in λ and annual productivity was also attributed to annual variation in nesting success. Management of this species has often focused on fall and overwinter survival, but population projection models provided little evidence that survival was the predominant factor affecting population growth of Ruffed Grouse in this region. A suite of confounding factors and demographic processes that drive population trends can differ significantly across a species' range. In the Upper Great Lakes region, management efforts aimed at maximizing reproductive success would likely have the greatest potential influence on Ruffed Grouse population growth. Other types of systematic, regional survey data can also be useful for validating population trends derived from demographic modeling studies.LAY SUMMARYThe Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) has been extensively studied, but few efforts have been made to synthesize demographic data into a sensitivity analysis to guide management.A comprehensive understanding of life history traits and vital rates that influence population growth is crucial for maximizing wildlife conservation and management efforts.We summarized Ruffed Grouse vital rates from field studies within the Upper Great Lakes region of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, USA, to evaluate population growth.Our analyses projected a stable but highly variable annual rate of population change for Ruffed Grouse in the Upper Great Lakes region.Management efforts aimed at maximizing reproductive success, particularly nesting success and chick survival, would likely have the greatest potential influence on Ruffed Grouse population growth.

AB  - Density dependence in vital rates is key to population regulation. Rather than being constant, the strength of density dependence may vary throughout the year, but empirical evidence is limited. Based on 22 years of data of color-banded birds from a recovering population of Eurasian Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia leucorodia, we show, for the first time, seasonal variation in density dependence in survival of a long-distance migrating bird. Combining resightings and dead recoveries at breeding, stopover, and nonbreeding areas enabled us to (1) separate true survival from permanent emigration from the breeding area, and (2) estimate survival in three seasons: summer, early winter (including autumn migration), and late winter (including spring migration). Accompanying the rapid population growth, juvenile annual survival initially increased, manifested in early winter, but thereafter, at high population sizes, it strongly decreased through a combination of decreasing survival in all seasons. Annual survival of subadult (second- and third-year) and adult birds decreased more gradually with increasing population size, with density dependence occurring in early winter for subadults and late winter for adults. Thus, the shape and strength of density dependence in survival varied with age and season. Understanding the seasonal timing of density dependence, especially with reference to underlying mechanisms, is important for the design of effective conservation strategies.

AB  - Hunters' preferences for different harvest principles and harvest regulations such as season length and harvest quotas provide important knowledge for wildlife management. We report results from a survey of 2788 willow ptarmigan hunters regarding commonly used harvest-principles and -regulations. A harvest quota strategy was the most preferred principle. Hunters were in general more positive to an annual bag, than daily quotas. Age was a particularly strong predictor of the ‘no winter hunt’ (after 23 December) regulation, and also a fairly strong predictor for the per annum and per day quota strategies respectively. This study has shown that ptarmigan hunters prefer annual quotas, rather than shortened hunting season or reduced number of hunters. We also emphasize the importance of social—ecological systems thinking when adaptive management strategies are developed and that management strategy evaluation models should be used to evaluate these strategies.

AB  - Hunting of game animals needs to be regulated, either through the number of permits or the bag size allowed per hunter. Such regulations may, however, jeopardize hunter satisfaction, on which game managers depend. Consequently, finding the optimal hunting intensity is not straightforward. Using data from Norwegian grouse hunting, we show that an integrated approach combining sociology and bioeconomics can give markedly different priorities than an optimization based exclusively on bioeconomics. Three grouse hunter typologies with contrasting stated preferences regarding bag size and crowding were used to account for varying hunter behavior. Omitting the social constructs from the model pushed the hunter density towards its upper limit, because the gain of selling one more permit generally superseded the loss in hunter satisfaction (expressed as willingness-to-pay). Although this strategy multiplied the overall profit, it produced a daily bag size that would be unacceptable to practically all hunters. We conclude that biosocioeconomic modeling is a valuable tool in the pursuit of sustainable game management.

AB  - <jats:p>Given the frequency with which translocation is implemented as a conservation tool, remarkably little research has assessed the sustainable management of translocation source populations. We sought to make an <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> estimate of the impact of multiple alternative harvesting scenarios on five passerine species endemic to Norfolk Island which may benefit from future translocation. Population parameters for our five focal taxa were quantified using distance sampling at 298 point surveys conducted in 2019. Intensive nest monitoring between 2018 and 2020 was used to estimate reproductive rates. We modelled population trajectories for all five taxa under alternative harvesting scenarios in forward projections over a 25‐year period to assess the likelihood that focal populations could recover from a harvesting event. We used sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of models to uncertainty around some population parameters. We estimate that Norfolk Island National Park supported 1486 Norfolk Robins <jats:italic>Petroica multicolor</jats:italic> (95% confidence interval (CI) 1017–1954), 7184 Slender‐billed White‐eyes <jats:italic>Zosterops tenuirostris</jats:italic> (95% CI 5817–8551), 2970 Norfolk Grey Fantails <jats:italic>Rhipidura albiscapa pelzini</jats:italic> (95% CI 2094–3846), 3676 Norfolk Gerygones <jats:italic>Gerygone modesta</jats:italic> (95% CI 2869–4482) and 1671 Norfolk Golden Whistlers <jats:italic>Pachycephala pectoralis xanthoprocta</jats:italic> (95% CI 1084–2259) in 2019. All five species were predicted to recover from the harvest of 50, 100 or 150 individuals within 10 years. Despite considerable variation in population parameters, we demonstrate that all five focal taxa have the potential to sustain harvesting at rates required for future conservation translocations. We provide a clear comparison of differing intensity harvesting strategies for on‐ground managers. More broadly, we provide a rare example of an <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> assessment of the impact of harvesting for translocation.</jats:p>

AB  - We investigated the general patterns of movements in willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) populations. We analyzed data from 300 radiocollared willow ptarmigan from 3 study areas in the Swedish mountain range, and from 2 previous studies of recoveries of wing-tagged chicks from 3 areas in southern Norway. We found that 80% of juvenile females dispersed more than 5 km from their natal area, whereas only 25% of juvenile males established a summer range more than 5 km from the area where they were caught as chicks. Mean dispersal distances of juvenile females were 3 times longer (10.4 km) than those of juvenile males (2.4 km). Movement differences within sexes were not associated with apparent female breeding success or ptarmigan density in the natal area, and adult females migrated between wintering areas used as juveniles and their first breeding site. We found no differences in dispersal distances between the Norwegian and Swedish populations. Movements of adult and juvenile females during spring were similar in all respects. At scales of more than 5 km, the movements of juveniles and adult females play a role in redistributing birds within landscape units, and represent important inter-population movements. The results of this study explain the apparent contradiction between non-compensatory mortality based on data from radio-marked ptarmigan, and the almost complete compensation based on annual counts. Estimating the extent of immigration into areas with high local mortality is difficult because of predation or harvest under conditions of high, fixed emigration and immigration dependent on local conditions. This represents a problem if dispersal distances include areas that are considerably larger than the size of the study area. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Several ground-nesting bird species living in European farmlands are experiencing a persistent decline. Poorer reproductive success is suspected to be the main demographic driver. We developed a model to quantify to what extent such recent change may impact the viability of their populations. We took the grey partridge Perdix perdix, a typical farmland species, as a well-documented case study, but the model can be adapted to other species. We built a model based on our in-depth demographic knowledge of this species and the large database compiled from our long-term population monitoring programme. We took into account environmental and demographic stochasticity as well as density-dependence processes. We investigated the impact of recent changes in reproductive success on the viability of (unharvested) populations. For this purpose, we considered two periods: 1979–2004 as ‘Past’ and 2005–2014 as ‘Present’ (we used data of subsequent years to test the model’s goodness of fit). During the ‘Past’ period, the simulated population was increasing with a mean stochastic growth rate λmean = 1.01 (25% of decreasing trajectories), whereas λmean = 0.89 during the ‘Present’ period (74% of decreasing trajectories). We provide detailed results and discuss the possible environmental causes, with a focus on extreme weather events. In a further step, we used our model as a tool to investigate the impact of four hunting bag management strategies on exploited populations. The hunting bag was assumed to be an additive cause of mortality. Hunting leads to a decrease in λmean but the amplitude (from minor to substantial) depends upon the strategy and the setting-up of parameters. We deliver our model as a tool to support decision-making for sustainable population management and provide the script (ULM software) as Supplementary information.

AB  - Global warming is predicted to cause substantial habitat rearrangements, with the most severe effects expected to occur in high-latitude biomes. However, one major uncertainty is whether species will be able to shift their ranges to keep pace with climate-driven environmental changes. Many recent studies on mammals have shown that past range contractions have been associated with local extinctions rather than survival by habitat tracking. Here, we have used an interdisciplinary approach that combines ancient DNA techniques, coalescent simulations and species distribution modelling, to investigate how two common cold-adapted bird species, willow and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus and Lagopus muta), respond to long-term climate warming. Contrary to previous findings in mammals, we demonstrate a genetic continuity in Europe over the last 20 millennia. Results from back-casted species distribution models suggest that this continuity may have been facilitated by uninterrupted habitat availability and potentially also the greater dispersal ability of birds. However, our predictions show that in the near future, some isolated regions will have little suitable habitat left, implying a future decrease in local populations at a scale unprecedented since the last glacial maximum.

AB  - According to classic theory, species interactions are less important than climatic variation for species population dynamics and distributions in climatically harsh regions compared with more climatically benign regions. In boreal ecosystems, the cyclic dynamics of rodents strongly affect many other species, including ground-nesting birds. According to the alternative prey hypothesis(APH), high rodent densities positively affect the abundance of ground-nesting birds due to predator-mediated interactions. We analysed a spatiotemporal dataset of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and rodents to examine how the role of predator-mediated interactions changes along a climatic harshness gradient in comparison with climatic variation. Ptarmigan and rodent data were collected during a national program of line-transect sampling across Norway during 2007-2017. We build a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the sensitivity of ptarmigan populations to interannual variation in climate and rodent occurrence. Ptarmigan abundance was positively linked with rodent occurrence, consistent with the APH. Moreover, we found that both rodent dynamics and temporal climatic variation had stronger effects on ptarmigan in colder regions. Our study highlights how species interactions play an important role for the population dynamics of species at higher latitudes and suggest that they become even more important in the most climatically harsh regions.

AB  - Natural resource management agencies in many countries take advantage of recreational hunting to manage the impacts or abundance of mammal populations that damage biodiversity or environmental, economic, or social values. In Australia, public lands are increasingly being made available for recreational hunters to pursue introduced mammals that can cause substantial damage to important resources. There is fervent debate over the role that recreational hunting might play in controlling introduced mammals in Australia, and scant evidence to build management strategies upon.     In this review, we combine information from Australia and elsewhere in a systematic examination of the potential for recreational hunting to contribute to the control of introduced mammals on public lands in Australia. We examine the traits of introduced mammal species and populations, geographical settings, hunters, and management agencies to propose situations where hunting might be most useful, and suggest how current practice could be improved.     We find there is insufficient evidence to support or disprove arguments that contemporary recreational hunting programs are effective at controlling introduced mammal populations on public lands. Moreover, current hunting management programs offer little potential for clarifying the situation or optimizing the value of recreational hunting as a pest animal control tool.     To resolve this problem, we outline a framework of competing models and diagnostic criteria for assessing the effects of recreational hunting on introduced mammal populations. We contend that hunting will continue to be an under-utilized and over-politicized resource until management strategy is informed by transparent monitoring based on rational strategic objectives that provide mutual benefits to hunters and public resource managers.

AB  - Ptarmigan are herbivorous birds that are year-round residents of alpine and arctic ecosystems — presently subjected to the most rapid climate warming on earth. Yet, compared to other bird taxa there has been little climate impact research on ptarmigan. Ptarmigan population dynamics, in particular in the sub/low-arctic, appears to be strongly influenced by complex interactions with a suite of functionally diverse predators in the food webs. We review evidence supporting that the strength of such predator—ptarmigan interactions has been altered, most likely due to climate change, having led to rapidly declining ptarmigan populations and in some places national red listing. Predation-mediated population declines are likely linked to dampened population cycles of keystone mammal herbivores (inducing increased apparent competition/reduced apparent mutualism), altitudinal/latitudinal expansions of boreal mesopredators and possibly mismatched ptarmigan plumage colour in spring and fall. Yet, other rapid food web...

AB  - For endangered species that are hunted, the establishment of mixed conservation areas including both hunting zones and sanctuaries to complement translocation actions (i.e. reinforcement) can improve both hunting yields and population sustainability. However, the effects of this type of management on the demography of the exploited species are not well understood. We used multi-event capture– recapture modelling in a population of captive-bred houbara bustards Chlamydotis undulata translocated into a mixed conservation area in Morocco. The specific management practice of our system (hunting regime varying in time and space) led to a quasi-experimental situation that allowed the differentiation of ‘natural’ from ‘hunting-induced’ mortality and movement between areas. The analysis uncovered strong asymmetries in both movement and survival that were not only due to direct hunting effects. Firstly, movement probabilities were higher from the sanctuary to the hunting areas than vice versa, even in years without hunting. Secondly, in addition to a direct effect of hunting on mortality in hunting areas, our results uncovered permanent differences in both areas (even outside the hunting period). Overall, our results were consistent with predictions under a source–sink dynamic model but illustrated that mixed conservation areas should not merely be treated as homogeneous systems with spatially heterogeneous hunting pressure but rather as fully heterogeneous systems. The patterns observed may be related to (1) the choice and design of hunting and sanctuary areas by managers, which might not be neutral with respect to habitat quality, or (2) indirect consequences of hunting via an effect on local growth rate and density.

AB  - 1. We investigated the effects of strong density-dependence on larval growth, development, and survival of the mosquito Culex restuans (Theobald). We tested the hypothesis that density reduction early in larval development could result in as many or more individuals surviving to adulthood (compensation or overcompensation, respectively), or increased reproductive performance via rapid development and greater adult size. 2. In a field study of a natural population of C. restuans we tested for the effects of a 75% lower density on percent survivorship to adulthood, number of adults, development time, adult size, adult longevity, and size dependent fecundity. 3. We found no evidence for compensation or overcompensation in adult production, nor for effects of lower density on percent survivorship. Low density yielded significant increases in adult size, adult longevity, and size-dependent fecundity, and a decrease in development time. 4. Estimated per capita population growth rate was significantly greater in the low-density treatment than in the high-density treatment. We infer this difference resulted from greater per capita resources increasing female size and fecundity, and reducing development time. Greater per capita population growth could therefore result from early mortality of larvae, meaning that the hydra effect, which predicts greater equilibrium population with, as opposed to without, extrinsic mortality, may be possible for these mosquitoes.

AB  - Abstract The northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is an economically important gamebird that is currently undergoing widespread population declines. Despite considerable research on the population ecology of bobwhites, there have been few attempts to model population dynamics of bobwhites to determine the contributions of different demographic parameters to variance of the finite rate of population change (λ). We conducted a literature review and compiled 405 estimates of 9 demographic parameters from 49 field studies of bobwhites. To identify demographic parameters that might be important for management, we used life-stage simulation analyses (LSA) to examine sensitivity of λ to simulated variation in 9 demographic parameters for female bobwhites. In a baseline LSA based on uniform distributions bounded by the range of estimates for each demographic parameter, bobwhite populations were predicted to decline (λ = 0.56) and winter survival of adults made the greatest contribution to variance of λ (r2 = 0...

AB  - Experimental research has identified many putative agents of amphibian decline, yet the population-level consequences of these agents remain unknown, owing to lack of information on compensatory density dependence in natural populations. Here, we investigate the relative importance of intrinsic (density-dependent) and extrinsic (climatic) factors impacting the dynamics of a tree frog (Hyla arborea) population over 22 years. A combination of log-linear density dependence and rainfall (with a 2-year time lag corresponding to development time) explain 75% of the variance in the rate of increase. Such fluctuations around a variable return point might be responsible for the seemingly erratic demography and disequilibrium dynamics of many amphibian populations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Management of reed beds primarily includes controlling water levels and removing vegetation by mowing, burning, or grazing. Although recent studies have demonstrated increased diversity and abundance of wetland specialists after reed bed management, documenting demographic benefits to individual species would add additional support to the advantages of appropriate management. Here, we explore the effects of reed management on the philopatry of Great Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) over 7 yr. Reed beds were managed in the winter by occasional burning at mining ponds and large canals, infrequent burning in marshes, and frequent mowing of small canals. Based on resightings and recaptures of 1,243 adult and 1,428 nestlings individually marked at 57 sites in 6 different reed habitats, we built Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to estimate the apparent annual survival and encounter probabilities of birds banded as nestlings or as adults.

AB  - The alternative prey hypothesis predicts that the interaction between generalist predators and their main prey is a major driver of population dynamics of alternative prey species. In Fennoscandia, changes in climate and human land use are assumed to alter the dynamics of cyclic small rodents (main prey) and lead to increased densities and range expansion of an important generalist predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes. In order to better understand the role of these potential changes in community structure on an alternative prey species, willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, we analyzed nine years of population census data from SE Norway to investigate how community interactions affected their population dynamics. The ptarmigan populations showed no declining trend during the study period, and annual variations corresponded with marked periodic small rodent peaks and declines. Population growth and breeding success were highly correlated, and both demographic variables were influenced by an interaction between red fox and small rodents. Red foxes affected ptarmigan negatively only when small rodent abundance was low, which is in accordance with the alternative prey hypothesis. Our results confirm the important role of red fox predation in ptarmigan dynamics, and indicate that if small rodent cycles are disrupted, this may lead to decline in ptarmigan and other alternative prey species due to elevated predation pressure.

Survival varies among populations of the same species and depends on several factors, including climatic events, density-dependent and density-independent factors, observed predator composition and whether recreational hunting occurs. Therefore, understanding factors affecting adult survival and estimating survival rates at biologically important times will help refine management of these populations. Aims We aimed to assess cause-specific mortality, estimate survival rates, and determine at what part of the winter (January to April) most mortalities occurred for female white-tailed deer located in the Northern Great Plains region of the USA. Methods We captured 165 adult female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) located in western North Dakota and north-western South Dakota, USA, during the winters of 2014 and 2015. We fitted individuals with Very High Frequency (VHF) radio-collars and located them 1–3 times per week to monitor survival. We investigated all mortalities to establish proximate cause of death. Key Results Survival was lowest during our Hunt time period (S = 0.93), although hunter harvest was not the leading cause of mortality. Predation was the greatest source of mortality, particularly during our Post-hunt time period. Additionally, almost 90% of mortalities occurring during the Post-hunt time period happened during late winter before spring green up. Conclusions and Implications Predation was the main source of mortality for adult females in our study, with coyotes (Canis latrans) being the sole predator capable of depredation in our study area. Predation by coyotes may indicate that potential factors, including winter severity and nutritional restrictions, have decreased female body condition, making individuals more susceptible to predation. Although we report relatively high survival, managers should consider the possibility that coyotes may impact adult populations, particularly in regions where other large-sized predators occur, or in regions where coyotes are newly established. Managers should also acknowledge that overwinter density estimates may need to be adjusted during severe winters to account for mortalities that occur after population surveys are conducted.

AB  - The relationship between the rate of predation and prey abundance is an important component of predator–prey dynamics. However, functional responses are less straightforward when multiple predators compete for shared prey. Interactions among competing predators can reduce or enhance effects of predation on prey populations. Because many avian populations experience high rates of nest predation, understanding the role of specific predators on nest mortality will lead to more informed conservation and management strategies which attempt to increase productivity by removing certain predators or managing habitat to limit their impact. Our goal was to evaluate effects of specific predators and the influence of nest abundance on nest mortality. We monitored snowy plover Charadrius nivosus nests across 7 years at two study areas in Utah, USA, with remote cameras. We modelled predator‐specific hazard rates for nest mortality in a Bayesian framework to assess relationships between competing predators and the role of nest abundance on predator‐specific hazard rates. We found that hazard rates for nest mortality by gulls Larus spp. decreased with increasing nest abundance, whereas nest mortality by foxes Vulpes spp. and ravens Corvus corax initially increased, indicating that dietary switching may occur when nests become more abundant. Nest mortalities of specific predators were often not independent and ranged between compensatory (e.g. mammalian mesopredators) and superadditive (e.g. avian predators) across the breeding season. The non‐independence between nest mortalities suggests that reductions in some predators may not translate to additive increases in overall nest success. Analyses of cause‐specific mortality are rarely applied to avian nests, but examination of interacting impacts among competing predators on nest survival may provide insight into specific drivers of avian population dynamics.

AB  - Harvesting for food or sport is often non-random with respect to demographic state, such as size or life stage. The population-level consequences of such selective harvesting depend upon which states are harvested and how those states contribute to population dynamics. We focused on a form of selective harvesting that has not previously been investigated in an experimental context: sex-selective harvesting, a common feature of exploited, dioecious populations. Using simple metapopulations (two patches connect by dispersal) of sexually dimorphic Bruchid beetles in the laboratory, we contrasted the effects of female-selective, male-selective, and non-selective harvesting over six generation of population dynamics. We also tested the ability of a harvest refuge (one patch of the metapopulation free from harvesting) to mitigate the effects of harvesting, and whether refuge effects interacted with sex selectivity. Sex-selective harvesting significantly perturbed operational sex ratios and harvest refuges dampened these perturbations. Metapopulations assigned to male-selective and non-selective treatments were able to fully compensate for harvesting, such that their dynamics did not differ from non-harvested controls. Only female-selective harvesting led to significant reductions in population size and this effect was completely offset by dispersal from a harvest refuge. A two-sex model confirmed that population dynamics are more sensitive to female vs. male harvesting, but suggested that higher levels of male harvest than included in our experiment would cause population decline. We discuss the roles of density-dependent competition and frequency-dependent sexual processes in the population response to sex-selective harvesting.

AB  - Summary     1. The effect of selective exploitation of certain age, stage or sex classes (e.g., trophy hunting) on population dynamics is relatively well studied in fisheries and sexually dimorphic mammals.     2. Harvesting of terrestrial species with no morphological differences visible between the different age and sex classes (monomorphic species) is usually assumed to be nonselective because monomorphicity makes intentionally selective harvesting pointless and impractical. But harvesting of the red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus), a monomorphic species, was recently shown to be unintentionally selective. This study uses a sex- and age-specific model to explore the previously unresearched effects of unintentional harvesting selectivity.     3. We examine the effects of selectivity on red grouse dynamics by considering models with and without selectivity. Our models include territoriality and parasitism, two mechanisms known to be important for grouse dynamics.     4. We show that the unintentional selectivity of harvesting that occurs in red grouse decreases population yield compared with unselective harvesting at high harvest rates. Selectivity also dramatically increases extinction risk at high harvest rates.     5. Selective harvesting strengthens the 3- to 13-year red grouse population cycle, suggesting that the selectivity of harvesting is a previously unappreciated factor contributing to the cycle.     6. The additional extinction risk introduced by harvesting selectivity provides a quantitative justification for typically implemented 20–40% harvest rates, which are below the maximum sustainable yield that could be taken, given the observed population growth rates of red grouse.     7. This study shows the possible broad importance of investigating in future research whether unintentionally selective harvesting occurs on other species.

AB  - Harvesting large carnivores is often a controversial issue and thus requires a higher precision than other types of recreational harvest. Despite this, management programmes are often initiated based on very limited knowledge about the state of the population and the composition and magnitude of the harvest. Here we analyse patterns of lynx harvest in Norway based on harvest data from 1994 to 2009. We found clear signs of sex-biased harvest rates, with males generally being more at risk. Further, harvest mortality rates increased with age among males but not among females. In general, the degree of quota filling was high, but there was a tendency for decreasing quota filling with increasing quotas. A population reconstruction of the Norwegian lynx population (1994–2004) based on a modified cohort analysis closely tracked the development in the official monitoring data, suggesting that the managers have access to relatively good information about the development of the population, at least at a larger spatial scale. Despite this, the population trajectory showed large temporal variation, and time lags in the management’s decision-making process are a likely cause of the observed patterns in the Norwegian lynx population.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity, especially in mortality risk, is a major factor shaping population dynamics. Here we study the impacts of spatial heterogeneity in hunting pressure on the demography of Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola, a relatively long-lived migratory game bird. We develop capture–recapture–recovery models in which both seasonality and spatial variation in hunting pressure are accounted for, and fit them to individual-based data collected across the French wintering range (>44000 banded individuals) as well as recoveries from spring stopovers and breeding grounds in Europe. Our results quantify spatial variation in survival probability in the wintering areas. They highlight the role of source-sink dynamics involving juvenile settlement decisions, as well as the importance of mortality outside the winter quarters. We also discuss the impact of spatial heterogeneity for demographic parameter estimation and data collection at the range scale.

AB  - Questions of whether trophic cascades occur in Isle Royale National Park (IRNP) or Yellowstone National Park's northern range (NR) cannot lead to simple, precise, or definitive answers. Such answers are limited especially by multicausality in the NR and by complex temporal variation in IRNP. Spatial heterogeneity, contingency, and nonequilibrium dynamics also work against simple answers in IRNP and NR. The existence of a trophic cascade in IRNP and NR also depends greatly on how it is defined. For example, some conceive of trophic cascades as entailing essentially any indirect effect of predation. This may be fine, but the primary intellectual value of such a conception may be to assess an important view in community ecology that most species are connected to most other species in a food web through a network of complicated, albeit weak, indirect effects. These circumstances that work against simple answers likely apply to many ecosystems. Despite the challenges of assessing the existence of trophic casca...

AB  - Abstract Population monitoring traditionally relies on population counts, accounting or not for the issue of detectability. However, this approach does not permit to go into details on demographic processes. Therefore, Capture-Recapture (CR) surveys have become popular tools for scientists and practitioners willing to measure survival response to environmental change or conservation actions. However, CR surveys are expensive and their design is often driven by the available resources, without estimation about the level of precision they provide for detecting changes in survival, despite optimising resource allocation in wildlife monitoring is increasingly important. Investigating how CR surveys could be optimised by manipulating resource allocation among different design components is therefore critically needed. We have conducted a simulation experiment exploring the statistical power of a wide range of CR survey designs to detect changes in the survival rate of birds. CR surveys differ in terms of number of breeding pairs monitored, number of offspring and adults marked, resighting effort and survey duration. We compared open-nest (ON) and nest-box (NB) monitoring types, using medium- and long-lived model species. Increasing survey duration and number of pairs monitored increased statistical power. Long survey duration can provide accurate estimations for long-lived birds even for small population size (15 pairs). A cost-benefit analysis revealed that for long-lived ON species, ringing as many chicks as possible appears as the most effective survey component, unless a technique for capturing breeding birds at low cost is available to compensate for reduced local recruitment. For medium-lived NB species, focusing the NB rounds at a period that maximises the chance to capture breeding females inside nest-boxes is more rewarding than ringing all chicks. We show that integrating economic costs is crucial when designing CR surveys and discuss ways to improve efficiency by reducing duration to a time scale compatible with management and conservation issues.

AB  - Large predators often suppress ungulate population growth, but they may also suppress the abundance of smaller predators that prey on neonatal ungulates. Antagonistic interactions among predators may therefore need to be integrated into predator–prey models to effectively manage ungulate–predator systems. We present a modeling framework that examines the net impact of interacting predators on the population growth rate of shared prey, using interactions among wolves Canis lupus, coyotes Canis latrans and Dall sheep Ovis dalli dalli as a case study. Wolf control is currently employed on approximately 16 million ha in Alaska to increase the abundance of ungulates for human harvest. We hypothesized that the positive effects of wolf control on Dall sheep population growth could be counteracted by increased levels of predation by coyotes. Coyotes and Dall sheep adult females (ewes) and lambs were radiocollared in the Alaska Range from 1999–2005 to estimate fecundity, age-specific survival rates, and causes of mortality in an area without wolf control. We used stage-structured population models to simulate the net effect of wolf control on Dall sheep population growth (λ). Our models accounted for stage-specific predation rates by wolves and coyotes, compensatory mortality, and the potential release of coyote populations due to wolf control. Wolves were the main predators of ewes, coyotes were the main predators of lambs, and wolves were the main source of mortality for coyotes. Population models predicted that wolf control could increase sheep λ by 4% per year in the absence of mesopredator release. However, if wolf control released coyote populations, our models predicted that sheep λ could decrease by up to 3% per year. These results highlight the importance of integrating antagonistic interactions among predators into predator–prey models, because the net effect of predator management on shared prey can depend critically on the strength of mesopredator release.

AB  - The willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) is an economically important and desired game species in Scandinavia. Its abundance varies considerably in time and space, but there has been a long-term population decline over recent decades. Earlier studies demonstrated willow ptarmigan select certain habitat features. We investigated the relationship between area-specific conditions (habitat and ownership status) and 2 variables describing willow ptarmigan demography (adult density and reproductive success). We found no connection between adult density and cover of 6 vegetation types. However, willow ptarmigan had lower reproductive success in survey areas dominated by mountain birch (Betula pubescens czerepanovii) forest. The lack of any clear association between willow ptarmigan density and vegetation types could be explained by relatively low population densities in our study areas. Thus, relative to years with higher population levels, resources (e.g., food and shelter) were plentiful and competition was low. We found strong indications in areas of similar vegetation composition that adult density was higher in areas managed by private landowners than on state-owned land. The difference in density was 2.56 birds/km2, equivalent to a 46% increase compared to adult density on state-owned land. This difference in density may be due to a difference in hunting pressure. We conclude that management actions to improve habitat will have little effect on willow ptarmigan populations during periods of relatively low densities. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region of central Canada supports a diverse community of breeding waterbirds, but many species have declining populations and the demographic mechanisms driving the declines remain unknown. We conducted a 7-year field study during 1995-2001 to investigate the demographic performance of Marbled Godwits (<i>Limosa fedoa</i>) and Willets (<i>Tringa semipalmata</i>) breeding in managed wetlands near Brooks, Alberta. Mark-recapture analyses based on Cormack-Jolly-Seber models revealed that the annual rates of apparent survival for Marbled Godwits ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:math>  = 0.953 ± 0.012SE) and Willets ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:math>  = 0.861 ± 0.015SE) are among the highest rates of survivorship reported for any breeding or nonbreeding population of large-bodied shorebirds. Our estimates of life expectancy for males were comparable to longevity records in godwits (17.3 years ±5.8SE vs. 25-29+ years) and willets (7.7 ± 1.5SE vs. 10+ years). The two species both showed strong breeding site fidelity but differed in rates of mate fidelity. Pairs that reunited and males that switched mates usually nested <300 m from their previous nests, whereas females that switched mates usually moved longer distances >1.1-1.5 km. Returning pairs usually reunited in godwits (85%) but not in willets (28%), possibly because of species differences in adult survival or patterns of migration. Baseline estimates of annual survival for banded-only birds will be useful for evaluating the potential effects of new tracking tags or the environmental changes that have occurred during the past 20 years. Conservation strategies for large-bodied shorebirds should be focused on reduction of exposure to anthropogenic mortality because low rates of natural mortality suggest that losses to collisions at breeding sites or harvest at nonbreeding areas are likely to cause additive mortality.

AB  - The Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) is an important small game species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula for which the incidence of roadkill is unknown. We surveyed Iberian hare-vehicle accidents on road networks in southern Spain, focusing on roads that mainly run through favorable habitats for this species: Mediterranean landscapes with plots of arable crops, olive groves, and vineyards. We recorded roadkills over a 5-month period, estimated hare accident densities on roads, and compared these numbers to hare hunting yields in adjoining hunting estates. We also analyzed the spatial patterns of and potential factors influencing hare roadkills. We detected the existence of black spots for hare roadkills in areas with high landscape heterogeneity that also included embankments and nearby crossroads and had high traffic intensity. Hare roadkill levels ranged from 5 to 25% of the annual harvest of hares killed on neighboring hunting estates. We suggest that road collisions should be considered in Iberian hare conservation in addition to hunting, since they may represent an additive source of mortality. Game managers should address the issue of hare roadkill in harvest planning to compensate for hare accidents, adjusting hunting quotas to account for this unnatural source of mortality. Our results suggest future directions for applied research in road ecology, including further work on demographic compensation and roadkill mitigation.

AB  - A main challenge in harvest management is to set policies that maximize the probability that the management goals are met. While the management cycle includes multiple sources of uncertainty, only some of these have receive considerable attention. Currently, there is a large gap in our knowledge about implemention of harvest regulations, and to which extent indirect control methods such as harvest regulations are actually able to regulate harvest in accordance with intended management objectives. In this perspective article, we first summarize and discuss hunting regulations currently used in management of grouse species (Tetraonidae) in Europe and North America. Management models suggested for grouse are most often based on proportional harvest or threshold harvest principles. These models are all built on theoretical principles for sustainable harvesting, and provide in the end an estimate on a total allowable catch. However, implementation uncertainty is rarely examined in empirical or theoretical harvest studies, and few general findings have been reported. Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence suggest that many of the most popular regulations are acting depensatory so that that harvest bag sizes is more limited in years (or areas) where game density is high, contrary to general recommendations. A better understanding of the implementation uncertainty related to harvest regulations is crucial in order to establish sustainable management systems. We suggest that scenario tools like Management System Evaluation (MSE) should be more frequently used to examine robustness of currently applied harvest regulations to such implementation uncertainty until more empirical evidence is available.

AB  - Recruitment of juveniles is important for the size of the next year’s breeding population in many bird species. Climate variability and predation may affect recruitment rates, and when these factors are spatially correlated, recruitment rates in spatially separated populations of a species may be synchronized. We used production data from an extensive survey of Willow Ptarmigan from 2000 to 2011 to investigate spatial synchrony in recruitment of juveniles within and among mountain region populations. In addition, we assessed the effects of predation and large—as well as local—scale climate on recruitment of juveniles. Recruitment was synchronized both within and among mountain regions, but the mean spatial correlation was strongest among mountain regions. This may be caused by small-scale factors such as predation or habitat structure, or be a result of sampling variation, which may be large at small spatial scales. The strong synchrony suggests that populations are subject to similar environmental forces. We used mixed effect models at the survey area and mountain region scales to assess the effect of rodent abundance (a proxy for predation rates) and local and regional climate during the breeding season on the recruitment of juvenile birds. Model selection based on AICc revealed that the most parsimonious models at both spatial scales included positive effects of rodent abundance and the North Atlantic oscillation during May, June and July (NAOMJJ). The NAOMJJ index was positively related to temperature and precipitation during the pre-incubation period; temperature during the incubation period and positive NAOMJJ values accelerate plant growth. A comparison of the relative effects of NAOMJJ and rodent abundance showed that variation in NAOMJJ had greatest impact on the recruitment of juveniles. This suggests that the climate effect was stronger than the effect of rodent abundance in our study populations. This is in contrast to previous studies on Willow Ptarmigan, but may be explained by the collapse in rodent cycles since the 1990s. If Willow Ptarmigan dynamics in the past were linked to the rodent cycle through a shared predator regime, this link may have been weakened when rodent cycles became more irregular, resulting in a more pronounced effect of environmental perturbation on the dynamics of ptarmigan.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                    <jats:p>The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is critical to avian conservation in the United States, both through its protection of migratory birds and as a catalyst for a century of coordinated avian conservation. While more than 1,000 species are protected by MBTA, of extant bird species native to the continental U.S., only 20 species belonging to the order Galliformes are explicitly excluded. Management of galliforms has occurred largely without direct federal oversight, placing this group on a fundamentally different conservation path during the century following MBTA passage. In this paper, we review the historical context and biological justification for exclusion of galliforms from MBTA and synthesize how their present-day conservation differs from that of migratory birds. We find the most prominent difference between the two groups involves the scope of coordination among stakeholders. The U.S. government, primarily via the Department of Interior, acts as de facto coordinating body for migratory bird conservation and plays the central role in oversight, funding, and administration of management in the United States. In contrast, galliform management falls primarily to individual state wildlife agencies, and coordinated conservation efforts have been more ad hoc and unevenly spread across species. Migratory birds benefit from an almost universally greater scope of research and monitoring, scale of habitat conservation, and sophistication of harvest management compared with galliforms. Galliform harvest management plans, in particular, are less likely to use measurable objectives, reporting of uncertainty in population parameters, and explanation of harvest management techniques. Based on a review of species status lists (e.g., the U.S. Endangered Species Act), we found no evidence that galliforms were more frequently listed than migratory species. Regional trend estimates from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) were more likely to be negative for galliforms over the period 1966–2015, but this was primarily driven by Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). Data to assess galliform population status are generally poor, which complicates assessment for roughly half of galliform species. Increased support for coordination among state agencies and other stakeholders, similar to that applied to migratory birds, could help to ensure that galliform conservation is poised to tackle forthcoming challenges associated with global change.</jats:p>

AB  - Mortality imposed on a population can interact with negatively density-dependent mortality to produce overcompensation, wherein added mortality results in more survivors. Experimental mortality can cause overcompensation in mosquito larvae, which would be counterproductive if it resulted from mosquito control in nature. We tested for different demographic responses to mortality among 3 container Aedes species when impacted by density dependence. We imposed 48.2% mortality on cohorts of larvae 2, 6, or 8 days after hatching and compared adult production, development times, and female size to those variables for controls without mortality. Mortality significantly increased adult production compared to controls, but the 3 species varied in the details of that response. Aedes albopictus (Skuse) produced more adults with mortality on day 2 primarily because of greater production of males. Aedes triseriatus (Say) yielded more adults with mortality on day 2 primarily because of greater production of females. Aedes aegypti (L.) adult production was not significantly affected by mortality, but development times for both sexes were significantly shorter with mortality on day 8. There were no effects of mortality on female wing length. None of our mortality treatments yielded significant reductions of adults for any species. These species responses to mortality are not the same, despite their similar ecologies and life histories. Thus, we cannot assume that killing almost half the larvae present in a dense population will reduce adult production, nor can we assume that different Aedes species will respond to mortality in the same way.

AB  - Alpine grouses are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their adaptation to extreme conditions and to their relict distributions in the Alps where global warming has been particularly marked in the last half century. Grouses are also currently threatened by habitat modification and human disturbance, and an assessment of the impact of multiple stressors is needed to predict the fate of Alpine populations of these birds in the next decades. We estimated the effect of climate change and human disturbance on a rock ptarmigan population living in the western Italian Alps by combining an empirical population modelling approach and stochastic simulations of the population dynamics under the a1B climate scenario and two different disturbance scenarios, represented by the development of a ski resort, through 2050.The early appearance of snow-free ground in the previous spring had a favorable effect on the rock ptarmigan population, probably through a higher reproductive success. On the contrary, delayed snowfall in autumn had a negative effect possibly due to a mismatch in time to molt to white winter plumage which increases predation risk. The regional climate model PROTHEUS does not foresee any significant change in snowmelt date in the study area, while the start date of continuous snow cover is expected to be significantly delayed. The net effect in the stochastic projections is a more or less pronounced (depending on the model used) decline in the studied population. The addition of extra-mortality due to collision with ski-lift wires led the population to fatal consequences in most projections. Should these results be confirmed by larger studies the conservation of Alpine populations would deserve more attention. To counterbalance the effects of climate change, the reduction of all causes of death should be pursued, through a strict preservation of the habitats in the present area of occurrence.

AB  - Understanding the interplay between exploitation and natural mortality is essential to guiding sustainable conservation of wildlife. Exploitation of carnivores by humans has long been thought to result in compensatory reductions of natural mortality among survivors. If rates of human exploitation exceed natural mortality, however, such actions will ‘add’ to overall mortality and could imperil the sustainability of such actions. We applied competing risk analyses to P16 years of data for heavily harvested and semi-protected cougar populations in Utah to test the additive and compensatory mortality hypotheses, while accounting for parameter uncertainty. We additionally tested for presence of the two primary mechanisms by which compensatory mortality can arise: density dependence and individual heterogeneity in mortality risks. Despite an opportunity for compensation in the heavily harvested population, we could not reject the additive mortality hypothesis when uncertainty in parameter estimates was accounted for. In the semi-protected population, however, we detected evidence for partial compensation of increased anthropogenic exploitation via reductions in natural mortality. As may be common in carnivore studies, we found that ignoring uncertainty in estimates of cause-specific mortality systematically led to biased conclusions regarding additive and compensatory mortality hypotheses. Efforts should be made to address and minimize this uncertainty in demographic studies of carnivores in order to avoid flawed management recommendations. To attain the necessary sample sizes for making sound inference, this may require that the spatial extent of management units be extended for territorial species with large home-range requirements.

AB  - Mortality rates and patterns are fundamental demographic traits for understanding the dynamics of populations of large herbivores in different environments. Despite the ongoing recovery of large carnivores in Europe and North America, few European studies on ungulate mortality are available from areas where both large carnivores and human hunters are present. We applied known fate models to estimate cause-specific mortality rates and Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the effects of environmental covariates on mortality risks of 330 radio-collared roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (1995–2005) along a gradient in roe deer abundance in south-eastern Norway. The study area is characterized by the presence of human hunters, Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and occasionally wolves (Canis lupus). The main mortality causes were: hunter harvest, predation by lynx, predation by foxes (on fawns) and others (including wolves, dogs, diseases, vehicle collisions and accidents). The individual ...

AB  - The expression of behaviour can vary both among (i.e. behavioural types (BTs)) and within individuals (i.e. plasticity), and investigating causes and consequences of variation has garnered significant attention. Conversely, studies quantifying harvest-induced selection (HIS) on behavioural traits have received significantly less attention, and work investigating HIS and natural selection simultaneously is rare. We studied sources of variation in three movement traits that represented risk-taking and one trait that represented exploration in male eastern wild turkeys (<i>Meleagris gallopavo silvestris</i>). We used data from 109 males in two hunted populations located in Georgia and South Carolina, USA. We assessed how both hunters and natural predators simultaneously influenced the selection of male turkey BTs. We found significant among-individual variation in all movement traits and adjustments in risk-taking and exploration relative to whether hunting was occurring. We observed that predators selected against similar BTs across both populations, whereas hunters selected for different BTs across populations. We also demonstrated that significant HIS acts on risk-taking behaviours in both populations, which could render wild turkeys more difficult to harvest if these traits are indeed heritable.

AB  - The management of sustainable harvest of animal populations is of great ecological and conservation importance. Development of formal quantitative tools to estimate and mitigate the impacts of harvest on animal populations has positively impacted conservation efforts. The vast majority of existing harvest models, however, do not simultaneously estimate ecological and harvest impacts on demographic parameters and population trends. Given that the impacts of ecological drivers are often equal to or greater than the effects of harvest, and can covary with harvest, this disconnect has the potential to lead to flawed inference. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical models and a 43-year capture-mark-recovery dataset from 404,241 female mallards Anas platyrhynchos released in the North American midcontinent to estimate mallard demographic parameters. Furthermore, we model the dynamics of waterfowl hunters and habitat, and the direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic and ecological processes on mallard demographic parameters. We demonstrate that density dependence, habitat conditions and harvest can simultaneously impact demographic parameters of female mallards, and discuss implications for existing and future harvest management models. Our results demonstrate the importance of controlling for multicollinearity among demographic drivers in harvest management models, and provide evidence for multiple mechanisms that lead to partial compensation of mallard harvest. We provide a novel model structure to assess these relationships that may allow for improved inference and prediction in future iterations of harvest management models across taxa.

AB  - —We developed procedures for successful capture, holding, transport, and release of ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.) based on field work in Colorado and Alaska during the last four decades. Use of improved translocation protocols led to successful establishment of new populations of White-tailed Ptarmigan (L. leucura) in four states, and reintroduction of Evermann’s Rock Ptarmigan (L. muta) to Agattu Island in the Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska. One of six translocation efforts failed due to inadequate site knowledge and transport in the Wallowa Mountains, Oregon (1967-1969). Translocations of birds in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California (1971-1972), Pikes Peak in Colorado (1975), Uinta Mountains in Utah (1976), New Mexico (1981), and to Agattu Island (2003-2006) in the western Aleutian Islands were site-specific and based on local knowledge (except in California). Procedures included capture of birds with noosing poles and ground nets at different times of year; holding birds under cool, quiet conditions for the shortest time possible (< 3 days), rapid transport, and release into vacant or restored habitats that were suitable for ptarmigan. Numbers of birds and sex ratios per release varied, and spring transplants of breeding birds were most successful. Post-release monitoring of banded birds in Colorado, Utah, and banded and or radiomarked birds at Agattu Island provided critical insights that were useful in refining our protocols for future translocation of ptarmigan and other grouse.

AB  - Abstract Despite increased knowledge about environmental toxins and changes in lead use (i.e., the mandated use of nonlead paint, gasoline, and shotgun pellets used for hunting waterfowl on federal lands), lead poisoning continues to occur in terrestrial birds. The degree of exposure and its demographic effect, however, continue to be described, emphasizing the growing concern over lead exposure. We examined 302 blood samples from common ravens (Corvus corax) scavenging on hunter-killed large ungulates and their offal piles to determine if lead rifle-bullet residuum was a point source for lead ingestion in ravens. We took blood samples during a 15-month period spanning 2 hunting seasons. Of the ravens tested during the hunting season, 47% exhibited elevated blood lead levels (≥10 μg/dL) whereas 2% tested during the nonhunting season exhibited elevated levels. Females had significantly higher blood lead levels than did males. Our results confirm that ravens are ingesting lead during the hunting season and ...

AB  - Investigating how and why the life history and demographic traits of a species vary across its range is fundamental to understand its evolution and population ecology and then develop sustainable management recommendations. At the margins of a species' distribution range, populations are expected to exhibit a slower pace of life than in core areas, making them less able to withstand pressures that impact survival. To explore these questions, we estimated age and sex-dependent seasonal survival probabilities using 305 radio-tagged birds monitored over a 18-year period in two alpine rock ptarmigan populations at the southern limit of their distribution, one in the Alps and one in the Pyrenees. We also estimated fecundity of both populations and then conducted sensitivity analysis as well as population viability analyses using deterministic and stochastic population models. Annual survival probability was high in both populations (0.65 for adults and 0.60 for juveniles), but reproductive success was much lower in the Alps (0.55 chicks per hen in the Alps vs 1.19 in the Pyrenees). The results showed that adult survival was the most sensitive demographic parameter. While population in the Pyrenees was stable (λ=1.01; 0.87–1.16), the other in the Alps appeared to be strongly declining (λ=0.81; 0.72–0.91) and this difference was clearly driven by differences of fecundity. While our findings confirm that our peripheral populations are associated with a slower pace of life, they present the particularity to be situated both at the edge and at high altitude. A more systematic study of peripheral population at higher latitude or on island may provide new insight on inter-pop variations of pace of life that would be useful for manager of these cold-adapted species. Key-words: Life history traits, demography, matrix model, telemetry, population viability analysis, age-class survival, fecundity.

Rapid climate change has been identified as the cause of this decline. Willow ptarmigan is adapted to harsh winter conditions, and winters with less snow could increase vulnerability when the ground is snow-free. In this study, we used a hierarchical state-space model to analyze 139 km line transects in mid-Sweden over 46 years. We assessed long-term trends in the adult population and estimated the effects of breeding success and climate on short-term changes. Contrary to our expectations, the adult population did not exhibit a negative trend. Breeding success was significantly positive for adult population change, but late spring had a significant negative effect on population change. The number of snow-free days in spring and autumn increased during the study; however, neither variable had a negative effect on adult population change. The adult willow ptarmigan followed a pattern of a stationary population under the influence of both stochastic and density-dependent factors, and changes in adults showed a negative density dependence. Our study area is in the southern range of the tundra, and we suggest that the stable dynamics of the adult population can be explained by a diverse predator assemblage that makes it impossible for the population to escape a top-down regulation.</jats:p>

AB  - Renewable energy resources have received increased attention because of impacts of fossil fuels on global climate change. In Kansas, USA, optimal sites for wind energy development often overlap with preferred habitats of the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), a lek-mating prairie grouse of conservation concern. We tested for potential effects of energy development on male Greater Prairie-Chickens in north-central Kansas. We captured males at 23 leks located 0.04 to 28 km from wind turbines during a 2-yr preconstruction period (2007–2008) and a 3-yr postconstruction period (2009–2011). First, we tested for effects of proximity to turbines, habitat, and lek size on annual probability of lek persistence and changes in male numbers. We predicted that energy development might result in behavioral avoidance of areas close to turbines, resulting in increased rates of lek abandonment and fewer males attending surviving leks. We found that distance to turbine had a negative effect on lek persistence for leks ,8 km from turbines during the postconstruction period, supporting the 8-km buffer zone recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an offset for wind energy projects. Additionally, lek persistence was positively related to number of males counted at a lek and with grassland cover surrounding the lek. Second, we tested for effects of wind energy development on male body mass. We predicted that degraded habitat conditions might result in decreased body mass for males attending leks near turbines during the postconstruction period. Male body mass was ~2% lower during the postconstruction period, but distance to turbine did not affect body mass. Additional study is needed to determine whether short-term effects of turbines on lek persistence influence population viability of Greater Prairie-Chickens.

AB  - Manipulating hunting season length is often used as a population management tool but the effects of these changes on total harvest have rarely been studied. We modelled relative changes in national annual bag size as a function of relative change in hunting season length in 63 cases involving 28 species in Denmark (1957–2007). The duration of the hunting season, initially lasting 30–365 days, was modified to 39–204% of the former length. The undifferentiated effect of season length change on bag size change (all 63 cases) was not statistically significant (b = 0.16, 95%CI: -0.04–0.36), with a 10% (95%CI: -3–22%) predicted decrease in bag size upon a 50% reduction of season length. However, the functional relationship between the relative change in bag size and the change in season length differed between sedentary and non-sedentary species and interacted with the motivation behind changing season length (population management/ethical/other). In non-sedentary species, changes in bag size correlated positiv...

AB  - Partial migration, where a portion of the population migrates between winter and summer (breeding) areas and the rest remain year-round resident, is a common phenomenon across several taxonomic groups. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain why some individuals migrate while others stay resident, as well as the fitness consequences of the different strategies. Yet, the drivers and consequences of the decision to migrate or not are poorly understood.We used data from radio-tagged female (<i>n</i> = 73) willow ptarmigan <i>Lagopus lagopus</i> in an alpine study area in Central Norway to test if (i) the decision to migrate was dependent on individual state variables (age and body weight), (ii) individuals repeated migratory decisions between seasons, and (iii) the choice of migratory strategy was related to reproductive success.Partially supporting our prediction that migratory strategy depends on individual state, we found that juvenile birds with small body sizes were more likely to migrate, whereas large juveniles remained resident. For adult females, we found no relationship between the decision to migrate or stay resident and body weight. We found evidence for high individual repeatability of migratory decision between seasons. Migratory strategy did not explain variation in clutch size or nest fate among individuals, suggesting no direct influence of the chosen strategy on reproductive success.Our results indicate that partial migration in willow ptarmigan is related to juvenile body weight, and that migratory behavior becomes a part of the individual life history as a fixed strategy. Nesting success was not affected by migratory strategy in our study population, but future studies should assess other traits to further test potential fitness consequences.

AB  - Sustainability of land use is a guiding paradigm for natural resource policy in the 21st century and should also be pursued in wildlife management. We have bridged the theoretical sustainability framework with practical policy implementation by defining a certification scheme whereby landowners implement game management systems that are aligned with sustainability standards and audited by accredited bodies. Oversight is provided by a governance committee, comprising scientists, public officers, and certification body representatives, ensuring adaptability to evolving societal attitudes and regulatory changes. Using the Delphi method with a panel of 78 experts we defined key sustainability criteria for sustainable game management following a criterion of consensus. The agreed criteria were structured around three dimensions: game population, habitat, and socio-economic aspects, forming a coherent framework. The seven most important criteria for defining a certification system focused on maintaining or improving: 1) game population abundance, distribution, structure, and behavior compatible with conservation; 2) natural genetic characteristics of game populations; 3) diversity and conservation status of native game species; 4) diversity of native non-game species; 5) conservation status and diversity of habitats; 6) socio-economic functions and conditions of the activity; and 7) customer satisfaction. We discuss how the label derived from this certification could serve as an identity brand with positive effects on the recreational hunting market, but also that the promotion of this system requires the commitment of policy makers as well as the valuing of hunters against other options less respectful of the natural environment.

AB  - Hunting has a long tradition in human evolutionary history and remains a common leisure activity or an important source of food. Herein, we first briefly review the literature on the demographic consequences of hunting and associated analytical methods. We then address the question of potential selective hunting and its possible genetic/evolutionary consequences. Birds have historically been popular models for demographic studies, and the huge amount of census and ringing data accumulated over the last century has paved the way for research about the demographic effects of harvesting. By contrast, the literature on the evolutionary consequences of harvesting is dominated by studies on mammals (especially ungulates) and fish. In these taxa, individuals selected for harvest often have particular traits such as large body size or extravagant secondary sexual characters (e.g. antlers, horns, etc.). Our review shows that targeting individuals according to such genetically heritable traits can exert strong selective pressures and alter the evolutionary trajectory of populations for these or correlated traits. Studies focusing on the evolutionary consequences of hunting in birds are extremely rare, likely because birds within populations appear much more similar, and do not display individual differences to the same extent as many mammals and fishes. Nevertheless, even without conscious choice by hunters, there remains the potential for selection through hunting in birds, for example by genetically inherited traits such as personality or pace-of-life. We emphasise that because so many bird species experience high hunting pressure, the possible selective effect of harvest in birds and its evolutionary consequences deserves far more attention, and that hunting may be one major driver of bird evolutionary trajectories that should be carefully considered in wildlife management schemes.

AB  - In heterogeneous landscapes individuals select among several habitat patches. The fitness rewards of these choices are assumed to play an important role in the distribution of individuals across landscapes. Individuals can either use environmental cues to directly assess the quality of breeding sites, or rely on social cues to guide the settlement decision. We estimated the density of adult birds and per capita reproductive success of willow ptarmigan over 5–15 years in 42 survey areas, nested within 5 spatially separated populations in south-central Norway. Our aims were to (1) examine spatial and temporal patterns of variation in densities of adult birds (i.e., the breeding densities) and reproductive success (juveniles/pair) measured in autumn and (2) evaluate which habitat distribution model best described the distribution of willow ptarmigan across heterogeneous mountain landscapes. Variation in density of adult birds was primarily attributable to variation between survey areas which could arise from spatial heterogeneity in adult survival or as a consequence of spacing behavior of juveniles during the settlement stage. In contrast, reproductive success was more variable between years and did not vary consistently between survey areas once year effects were accounted for. The lack of any relationship between the density of adult birds and reproductive success supported the predictions of an ideal free distribution (IFD), implying that within years, the mean reproductive success was approximately equal across survey areas. However, analysis based on Taylor’s power law (i.e., the relationship between logarithms of spatial variance and mean density of adult birds) suggested that aggregation was stronger than expected under IFD. This implies that the relative change in density of adult birds was larger in areas with high mean densities than in areas with low densities. The exact mechanisms causing this statistical pattern are unclear, but based on the breeding biology of willow ptarmigan we suggest that yearlings are attracted to areas of high densities during the settlement period in spring. Our study was conducted during a period of low overall density and we suggest that this pattern might be particular to such situations. This implies that the presence of conspecifics might represent a cue signaling high adult survival and thus high habitat quality.

AB  - We study the dynamics of the capercaillie, black grouse, hazel grouse and willow grouse in Kainuu game management district in northeastern Finland in the years 1989 – 2004. It appears that the 6 – 7 year periodicity that prevailed in this region from 1960s up to 1980s has now vanished in all species. Th e grouse data are modelled using a linear autoregressive model with lag terms for population dynamics including grouse harvest as annual bag and an index of winter severity (winter-time area of Baltic Sea ice cover). We use the Akaike information criterion for selecting the best model for each species; fi rst order lag is forced to the models. It turns out that a term is needed for harvesting (with a negative coeffi cient) in models for all species. For the capercaillie and the hazel grouse second order lag was included, for the black grouse and the willow grouse fi rst order lag suffi ces. Th e willow grouse is the only species where the index of winter strength (with a negative coeffi cient) is needed in the model.

AB  - Carrion production is one of the most crucial yet neglected and understudied processes in food webs and ecosystems. In this study, we performed a large-scale estimation of the maximum potential production and spatial distribution of ungulate carrion biomass from five major sources in peninsular Spain, both anthropogenic (livestock, big game hunting, roadkills) and natural (predation, natural mortality). Using standardized ungulate carrion biomass (kg/year/100km 2 ) estimates, we evaluated the relationship between ungulate carrion production and two ecosystem-level factors: global human modification (GHM) and primary productivity (NDVI). We found that anthropogenic carrion sources supplied about 60 times more ungulate carrion biomass than natural sources (mean = 90,172 vs. 1533 kg/year/100km 2 , respectively). Within anthropogenic carrion sources, livestock was by far the major carrion provider (91.1% of the annual production), followed by big game hunting (7.86%) and roadkills (0.05%). Within natural carrion sources, predation of ungulates provided more carrion (0.81%) than natural mortality (0.13%). Likewise, we found that the spatial distribution of carrion differed among carrion sources, with anthropogenic carrion being more aggregated in space than natural carrion. Our models showed that GHM was positively related to carrion production from livestock and roadkills, and that wild ungulate carrion supplied by natural sources and big game hunting was more frequently generated in more productive areas (higher NDVI). These findings indicate a disconnection between the main ungulate carrion source (livestock) and primary productivity. Ongoing socio-economic changes in developed countries (for example increase of intensive livestock husbandry and rewilding processes) could lead to additional alteration of carrion production processes, with potential negative impacts at the community and ecosystem levels. Overall, we highlight that carrion biomass quantification should be considered a crucial tool in evaluating ecosystem health and delineating efficient ecosystem management guidelines in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Context. Despite their economic importance and intensive management, many game bird species, including the northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus, are in decline. Declines may be explained, at least in part, by low survival due perhaps to poor habitat quality, high predation or excessive hunting pressure. Aims. This study sought to estimate and model annual/seasonal survival probabilities, to evaluate factors influencing them and to determine the cause-specific mortality rates for northern bobwhites subject to varying levels of harvest on the Babcock–Webb Wildlife Management Area (BW area), south Florida, USA. Methods. We applied Cox’s proportional hazard models to data collected from 2066 radio-tagged bobwhites during 2002–2008 to test for intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting survival and the non-parametric cumulative incidence function estimator to estimate cause-specific mortality rates. Key results. Mean annual survival (0.091 ± 0.006) in the BW area was lower than most estimates reported for other bobwhite populations. Annual survival differed between adults (0.111 ± 0.008) and juveniles (0.052 ± 0.008), and varied among years. Survival in winter (October–March; 0.295 ± 0.014) was similar to that in summer (April–September; 0.307 ± 0.013). Density of food strips (i.e. long and narrow food plots) did not influence survival, but hunting effort (number of hunters per day per km2) had a substantial negative impact on survival. In the lightly hunted field trial zone, winter (October–March) survival was significantly higher (0.414 ± 0.035) than in the other more heavily hunted management zones (0.319 ± 0.016). Cause-specific mortality analyses revealed that bobwhite mortality during summer (April–September) was mainly due to raptor (39.7%) and mammalian predation (35.6%), whereas hunting was the primary cause of mortality during winter (47.1%). Conclusions. Our results highlight the potential role of harvest as an important cause of the northern bobwhite population declines in south Florida. High mortality during winter may reduce recruitment of juveniles to the reproductive segment of the population, and ultimately the population growth. Implications. Our results suggest that reduction in hunting pressure may be necessary to reverse the declining population trends in heavily hunted game species in public lands, such as the northern bobwhites in the BW area.

AB  - The degree to which predation is an additive vs. compensatory source of mortality is fundamental to understanding the effects of predation on prey populations and evaluating the efficacy of predator management actions. In the Columbia River basin, USA, predation by Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) on U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed juvenile salmonids (smolts; Oncorhynchus spp.) has led to predator management actions to reduce predation; however, the assumption that reduced predation translates into greater salmonid survival, either within the life stage where predation occurs or across their lifetime, has remained untested. To address this critical uncertainty, we analyzed a long-term (2008-2018) mark-recapture-recovery data set of ESA-listed steelhead trout (O. mykiss) that were tagged (n = 78,409) and subsequently exposed to predation during smolt out-migration through multiple river reaches (spatial scales), jointly estimating weekly probabilities of steelhead survival, mortality due to bird predation, and mortality due to other causes. This concurrent estimation across time-stratified cohorts allowed for the direct measurement of the strength, magnitude, and direction of relationships between survival and Caspian Tern predation. Estimates of Tern predation on steelhead were substantial in most years, with cumulative annual estimates ranging from 0.075 (95% creditable interval = 0.058-0.099) to 0.375 (0.290-0.461). Increases in Tern predation probabilities were associated with statistically significant decreases in steelhead survival probabilities in all evaluated years and salmonid life stages (smolt out-migration and smolt-to-adult returns). Results provide novel evidence that predation by Caspian Terns may have been a super-additive source of mortality during the smolt life stage and a partially additive source of mortality to the adult life stage. Annual estimates of the difference between observed survival and baseline survival (i.e., in the absence of Tern predation) ranged from 0.052 (0.017-0.103) to 0.314 (0.172-0.459) during the steelhead smolt life stage and from 0.011 (0.001-0.029) to 0.049 (0.025-0.078) to the adult life stage. The estimated levels of compensation have important implications for predator management actions aimed at increasing the survival of endangered salmonids, and the modeling approach developed herein provides a framework to directly quantify the impacts of source-specific mortality factors on prey populations.

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Density dependence, immigration, and emigration can considerably influence wildlife population demographics. Population models used to evaluate common actions like predator management and harvest in the absence of these processes may lead to poor management decisions. We built a novel population simulation model for the northern bobwhite (<jats:italic>Colinus virginianus</jats:italic>; bobwhite) that included implicit spatial structure (ingress and egress of individuals), density dependence, and harvest. We used 42 years of data (1970–2012) from a relatively stable population to create and validate the simulation model. We then used this simulation model to predict the effect of meso‐mammal trap and removal, a management action that increases bobwhite fecundity, on population abundance, cumulative harvest through 50 years, and extirpation risk. We conducted a population sensitivity analysis to understand the implications of meso‐mammal trap and removal to populations with varying vital rates. Incorporating ingress and egress of individuals and density dependence improved the understanding of bobwhite population dynamics and reduced the uncertainty about the efficacy of predator management across a range of environmental conditions. Increased number of immigration sources decreased extirpation risk and increased bobwhite abundance. A key outcome of our modeling process was that density‐dependent processes did not fully compensate for harvest. Cumulative harvest through 50 years increased with increasing harvest rate but started to decline when harvest rate was &gt;0.35 for populations with meso‐mammal removal and 0.25–0.30 for populations without meso‐mammal removal. Meso‐mammal removal increased the harvest capacity of populations and produced greater harvest opportunity over time. Meso‐mammal removal also buffered populations from extirpation risk resulting from too few immigration sources. Practitioners often ignore the contribution of immigration and emigration to local demographics or assume density‐independent vital rates; however, recent literature reviews and our study indicate that these processes are important to the understanding of animal ecology and management. In the interest of the conservation of species that are hunted and at risk of extirpation in some geographies, predator management may increase hunter success and be a tool to reduce extirpation risk, although the degree of effectiveness likely varies geographically. This manuscript could serve as a framework for predicting the effects of management on bobwhite at the population level. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.</jats:p>

AB  - Evidence that infectious diseases cause wildlife population extirpation or extinction remains anecdotal and it is unclear whether the impacts of a pathogen at the individual level can scale up to population level so drastically. Here, we quantify the response of a Common eider colony to emerging epidemics of avian cholera, one of the most important infectious diseases affecting wild waterfowl. We show that avian cholera has the potential to drive colony extinction, even over a very short period. Extinction depends on disease severity (the impact of the disease on adult female survival) and disease frequency (the number of annual epidemics per decade). In case of epidemics of high severity (i.e., causing >30% mortality of breeding females), more than one outbreak per decade will be unsustainable for the colony and will likely lead to extinction within the next century; more than four outbreaks per decade will drive extinction to within 20 years. Such severity and frequency of avian cholera are already observed, and avian cholera might thus represent a significant threat to viability of breeding populations. However, this will depend on the mechanisms underlying avian cholera transmission, maintenance, and spread, which are currently only poorly known.

AB  - Demographic compensation, the increase in average individual performance following a perturbation that reduces population size, and, its opposite, demographic overadditivity (or superadditivity) are central processes in both population ecology and wildlife management. A continuum of population responses to changes in cause-specific mortality exists, of which additivity and complete compensation constitute particular points. The position of a population on that continuum influences its ability to sustain exploitation and predation. Here I describe a method for quantifying where a population is on the continuum. Based on variance-covariance formulae, I describe a simple metric for the rate of compensation-additivity. I synthesize the results from 10 wildlife capture-recapture monitoring programmes from the literature and online databases, reviewing current statistical methods and the treatment of common sources of bias. These results are used to test hypotheses regarding the effects of life-history strategy, population density, average cause-specific mortality and age class on the rate of compensation-additivity. This comparative analysis highlights that long-lived species compensate less than short-lived species and that populations below their carrying capacity compensate less than those above.

AB  - Harvest indices are used by state wildlife management agencies to monitor population trends and set harvest quotas for furbearer species. Although harvest indices may be readily collected from hunters, the reliability of harvest indices for monitoring demography and abundance of the harvested species is rarely examined, particularly amongst large carnivores. The overall objective of this study was to assess whether cougar (Puma concolor) harvest statistics collected bywildlife managers were correlated with changes in cougar demography, mainly survival rates and abundance. We estimated key demographic parameters for 2 cougar populationsinUtah over17years during whichwemonitored235 radio-collared cougars. Wethencompared these demographic parameters to harvest statistics provided by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources over the same time period for the Oquirrh-Stansbury (lightly harvested population) and Monroe (heavily harvested population) harvest management units. In the Oquirrh-Stansbury unit, the percent of harvested cougars >6 years old was positively correlated with annual survival, indicative of a population experiencing several years of high survival resulting in an older age structure. Percent of permits filled and cougar abundance were also significantly correlated, suggesting higher hunting success with increased density. In the Monroe management unit, the annual percent of permits filled was correlated with changes in overall annual survival and male and female annual survival. Of utmost importance, pursuit success (cougars treed/day) increased with the number of cougars on the unit suggesting that pursuit indices may be an informative metric for wildlife managers to determine cougar population trends. Because both management units were subjected to contrasting mortality regimes, results provided by this assessment could potentially be applied to additional management areas sharing similar ecological characteristics and harvest metrics.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Estimating survival and cause‐specific mortality of male eastern wild turkeys (<jats:italic>Meleagris gallopavo silvestris</jats:italic>) is important for understanding population dynamics and implementing appropriate harvest management. To better understand age‐specific estimates of annual survival and harvest rates, we captured and marked male wild turkeys with leg bands (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 311) or bands and transmitters (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 549) in Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina, USA, during 2014–2022. We fitted time to event models to data from radio‐marked birds to estimate cause‐specific mortality and annual survival. We used band recovery models incorporating both band recovery and telemetry data to further investigate harvest rates and survival. Annual survival from known‐fate models in hunted populations was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.49–0.59) for adults and 0.86 (95% CI = 0.81–0.92) for juveniles. Cause‐specific mortality analysis produced an annual harvest estimate of 0.29 (95% CI = 0.24–0.33) for adults and 0.02 (95% CI = 0.01–0.03) for juveniles, whereas predation was 0.15 (95% CI = 0.10–0.20) and 0.12 (95% CI = 0.08–0.17), respectively. Annual survival for adult males in a non‐hunted population was 0.83 (95% CI = 0.72–0.97). Survival rate was negatively correlated with harvest rate, indicating harvest was an additive mortality source. Annual survival from band recovery models was 0.40 (95% CI = 0.37–0.44) for adults and 0.88 (95% CI = 0.81– 0.93) for juveniles, whereas annual harvest estimates were 0.24 (95% CI = 0.23–0.25) for adults and 0.04 (95% CI = 0.03–0.05) for juveniles. Both models suggested no differences in annual survival across years or among study areas, which included privately owned and public properties. Harvest was an additive mortality source for male wild turkeys, suggesting that managers interested in increasing annual survival of adult males could consider ways of reducing harvest rates.</jats:p>

AB  - Overabundant native animals cause a variety of human-wildlife conflicts that can require management to reduce their social, environmental, or economic impacts. Culling is an intuitively attractive management response to overabundance, but poor monitoring of results and costs means that evidence for successful outcomes is often lacking. Furthermore, many culls worldwide have been ineffective or counterproductive due to ecological release mechanisms or compensatory responses by the overabundant species. We completed a controlled, replicated, costed, and rigorously monitored experimental cull of the endemic Australian honeyeater, the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala). Aggressive exclusion of birds from remnant woodland patches by overabundant Noisy Miners is listed as a Key Threatening Process under Australian conservation legislation due to its impacts on threatened birds. The problem is particularly prevalent in the highly modified agricultural landscapes of eastern Australia. The species impacts avian assemblages at low densities (0.6-0.8 birds/ha) and at a subcontinental scale (>1 million km2 ). Some ecologists recommend culling as the only management response capable of timely reversal of declines of threatened small woodland birds. We monitored Noisy Miner abundance before and for 12 months after a culling program and found that immediate recolonization from the surrounding landscape negated the impact of the cull. We hypothesize that this is due to a vacuum effect; whereby, birds resident in more marginal habitat around treatment patches move into the vacant territory post-cull. Modeled mean abundance of Noisy Miners declined by 22% in treatment sites compared to an increase of 4% in control sites in the post-cull period. Abundance in all sites, however, remained three to five times higher than published ecological impact thresholds. Return on investment analysis indicated no relationship between culling effort and reduction in Noisy Miner abundance. We conclude that culling at a patch scale is not an efficient method of reducing Noisy Miner abundance to levels unlikely to impact threatened woodland birds in the highly modified study landscape, despite estimated costs 18 times lower than another potential management response of revegetation. Our study highlights the importance of building empirical evidence before intuitively attractive but not necessarily ecologically effective management responses are applied more widely.

AB  - Understanding demographical processes underlying abundance and population size fluctuations is critical to species management. Knowing key parameters and responses to observed changes can reduce the number of realistic management scenarios. In hunted species, survival might be the targeted parameter for effective plans. The red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa is a native species in Mediterranean countries. The species is hunted, especially in France where some release plans are implemented. However, survival estimates are scarce there and most studies were conducted in Spain. Here, we took advantage of a radio-tracking experiment in southern France (200 birds surveyed) to estimate monthly and annual survival rates of both wild and released red-legged partridge and to investigate the temporal, spatial and individual variations in survival. We found very high annual survival rate in our island site (0.70) and low survival elsewhere (range: 0.25–0.29). We showed that age and sex were a significant source of variation in annual survival of wild birds with lower estimates for young and for females. The close survival between mainland sites with different mortality sources suggests that compensation may occur between predation and hunting mortality. However, a stronger assessment of this point is needed. Our study suggests that environment characteristics, especially landscape mosaic and predation pressure, was a driver of survival. On the island site, the red-legged partridge shows a different demographic tactics (higher survival, lower reproduction) than in mainland, suggesting an adaptation to the context (lower predation). Regarding hand-reared birds released just before the hunting season, their survival to the next spring was lower than 0.05. Such a low value raises the issue of using release before the hunting season for reinforcement purpose, especially due to negative impact through the general increase in hunting pressure it promotes. Habitat and hunting management may thus be a key to favour the red-legged partridge.

AB  - A main objective of game management on public lands in Norway is to ensure that harvest levels are sustainable while securing hunting access to the public. The willow ptarmigan is a popular but red-listed small game species, and it is challenging for managers to optimize harvest levels based on uncertain population estimates and limited knowledge of the factors influencing hunting impact. We studied how willow ptarmigan hunting effort, catch per unit effort, and harvest rates were influenced by ptarmigan density, topography, vegetation, and infrastructure. Data were collected during 2013–2016 from 162 hunting blocks covering 26,828 km2 state-owned land in the counties Nordland and Troms, northern Norway. Hunting effort averaged 1.27 days/km2 (SD = 2.08), and it was the highest in areas close to roads and cabins. We found an opposite effect on the catch per unit effort (CPUE, mean = 0.77 ptarmigan/day, SD = 0.48), which was lower close to roads. There was a marked positive effect of density on CPUE, whereas terrain steepness (slope) had a negative effect. On average, harvest removed < 10% of the autumn population in the hunting areas during the study period. This indicates a relatively low and partially compensatory hunting mortality in most years and areas. Although this study shows a low harvest rate, we recommend managers to survey ptarmigan populations, hunting effort, and harvest, especially in easily accessible areas close to infrastructure and in periods of low population density.

AB  - The global movement of pathogens is altering populations and communities through a variety of direct and indirect ecological pathways. The direct effect of a pathogen on a host is reduced survival, which can lead to decreased population densities. However, theory also suggests that increased mortality can lead to no change or even increases in the density of the host. This paradoxical result can occur in a regulated population when the pathogen's negative effect on survival is countered by increased reproduction at the lower density. Here, we analyze data from a long-term capture-mark-recapture experiment of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that were recently infected with a nematode parasite (Camallanus cotti). By comparing the newly infected population with a control population that was not infected, we show that decreases in the density of the infected guppy population were transient. The guppy population compensated for the decreased survival by a density-dependent increase in recruitment of new individuals into the population, without any change in the underlying recruitment function. Increased recruitment was related to an increase in the somatic growth of uninfected fish. Twenty months into the new invasion, the population had fully recovered to preinvasion densities even though the prevalence of infection of fish in the population remained high (72%). These results show that density-mediated indirect effects of novel parasites can be positive, not negative, which makes it difficult to extrapolate to how pathogens will affect species interactions in communities. We discuss possible hypotheses for the rapid recovery.

AB  - Context Hunting-related (hereafter harvest) mortality is assumed to be compensatory in many exploited species. However, when harvest mortality is additive, hunting can lead to population declines, especially on public land where hunting pressure can be intense. Recent studies indicate that excessive hunting may have contributed to the decline of a northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) population in south Florida. Aims This study aimed to estimate population growth rates to determine potential and actual contribution of vital rates to annual changes in population growth rates, and to evaluate the role of harvest and climatic variables on bobwhite population decline. Methods We used demographic parameters estimated from a six-year study to parameterise population matrix models and conduct prospective and retrospective perturbation analyses. Key results The stochastic population growth rate (λS = 0.144) was proportionally more sensitive to adult winter survival and survival of fledglings, nests and broods from first nesting attempts; the same variables were primarily responsible for annual changes in population growth rate. Demographic parameters associated with second nesting attempts made virtually no contribution to population growth rate. All harvest scenarios consistently revealed a substantial impact of harvest on bobwhite population dynamics. If the lowest harvest level recorded in the study period (i.e. 0.08 birds harvested per day per km2 in 2008) was applied, λS would increase by 32.1%. Winter temperatures and precipitation negatively affected winter survival, and precipitation acted synergistically with harvest in affecting winter survival. Conclusions Our results suggest that reduction in winter survival due to overharvest has been an important cause of the decline in our study population, but that climatic factors might have also played a role. Thus, for management actions to be effective, assessing the contribution of primary (e.g. harvesting) but also secondary factors (e.g. climate) to population decline may be necessary. Implications Reducing hunting pressure would be necessary for the recovery of the bobwhite population at our study site. In addition, an adaptive harvest management strategy that considers weather conditions in setting harvest quota would help reverse the population decline further.

AB  - Harvest of wild organisms is an important component of human culture, economy, and recreation, but can also put species at risk of extinction. Decisions that guide successful management actions therefore rely on the ability of researchers to link changes in demographic processes to the anthropogenic actions or environmental changes that underlie variation in demographic parameters. Ecologists often use population models or maximum sustained yield curves to estimate the impacts of harvest on wildlife and fish populations. Applications of these models usually focus exclusively on the impact of harvest and often fail to consider adequately other potential, often collinear, mechanistic drivers of the observed relationships between harvest and demographic rates. In this study, we used an integrated population model and long-term data (1973-2016) to examine the relationships among hunting and natural mortality, the number of hunters, habitat conditions, and population size of blue-winged teal Spatula discors, an abundant North American dabbling duck with a relatively fast-paced life history strategy. Over the last two and a half decades of the study, teal abundance tripled, hunting mortality probability increased slightly ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&amp;lt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.02</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:semantics> </mml:math> ), and natural mortality probability increased substantially ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&amp;gt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:semantics> </mml:math> ) at greater population densities. We demonstrate strong density-dependent effects on natural mortality and fecundity as population density increased, indicative of compensatory harvest mortality and compensatory natality. Critically, an analysis that only assessed the relationship between survival and hunting mortality would spuriously indicate depensatory mortality due to multicollinearity between abundance, natural mortality and hunting mortality. Our findings demonstrate that models that only consider the direct effect of hunting on survival or natural mortality can fail to accurately assess the mechanistic impact of hunting on population dynamics due to multicollinearity among demographic drivers. This multicollinearity limits inference and may have strong impacts on applied management actions globally.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effects of hunting on wildlife populations vary dramatically, depending on the timing and magnitude of harvest, and population‐specific states and vital rates. We examined the hypothesis that spatially and seasonally concentrated harvest decreases annual survival probabilities of willow ptarmigan (<jats:italic>Lagopus lagopus</jats:italic>). We estimated survival of radio‐marked willow ptarmigan at 2 categories of sites: those where ptarmigan were easily accessible and heavily hunted and those that were remote and received little or no hunting pressure in Alaska, USA. We predicted that seasonal survival estimates during the willow ptarmigan hunting season would be lower in access corridors than at remote sites and that this would result in lower annual survival unless subsequent seasonal compensatory mortality occurred. Consistent with our prediction, annual survival was higher at remote sites (adult males: 0.50, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.42–0.57; adult females: 0.36, 95% CrI = 0.26–0.46; juveniles: 0.39, 95% CrI = 0.29–0.50) than at accessible sites (adult males: 0.36, 95% CrI = 0.26–0.46; adult females: 0.23, 95% CrI = 0.12–0.32; juveniles: 0.25, 95% CrI = 0.13–0.37) for all demographic groups. Concentrated harvest occurred in accessible sites during the hunting season (Aug–Mar). During the post‐breeding season (Aug–Nov), when willow ptarmigan were near their breeding sites and the hunting season was open, survival was higher for those from remote sites than for those from accessible sites when accounting for demographic group (adult male, adult female, juvenile). In contrast, during winter (Dec–Mar), when willow ptarmigan had moved away from breeding territories and were no longer segregated into remote and accessible sites, survival estimates did not differ between those from remote breeding territories and those from accessible breeding territories. This pattern of differential survival indicates an association between concentrated hunting at accessible sites and reduced survival, and it suggests an additive component of harvest mortality. In addition, the timing of these survival patterns relative to seasonal movements suggests that early season harvest (prior to seasonal movements away from breeding territories) may have a greater impact on local breeders in accessible areas than later harvest.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Prey species must consistently balance the need for resource acquisition with the threat of predation. This balance is particularly true for gallinaceous birds, such as the northern bobwhite (<jats:italic>Colinus virginianus</jats:italic>), which are ground foragers and are often exposed to increased predation risk compared to arboreal foragers. We studied how bobwhites might mitigate the threat of human hunting pressure by altering their foraging strategy. We directly monitored hunting encounters with bobwhites, during October 2014–March 2015, and collected daily movement paths (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 514) using radio‐telemetry. We performed first‐passage time analysis to infer foraging behavior by calculating bout frequency, area, duration, and timing. We found bobwhites mitigated exposure to human hunters by increasing foraging frequency coupled with a decrease in duration (15.4%) and area (7.1%) in response to hunting pressure. We observed a temporal shift in foraging away from peak hunting hours by 30 minutes when birds were recently exposed to a discharged firearm. Our results imply that hunting game species can disrupt timing of foraging and therefore influence allocation to competing activities such as anti‐predator vigilance. We propose implementing a dynamic harvest management regime that distributes hunting activity temporally and spatially to mitigate high hunting pressure and reduce behavioral effects on bobwhites. Careful planning of hunting activity should reduce its additive effects on natural mortality while improving hunter satisfaction. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.</jats:p></jats:sec>

AB  - OF DISSERTATION ECOLOGY OF TWO REINTRODUCED BLACK BEAR POPULATIONS IN THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS Reintroduced populations are vulnerable to demographic and environmental stochasticity, deleterious genetic effects, and reduced population fitness, all of which can increase extinction probability. Population viability is principle to determining the status of reintroduced populations and for guiding management decisions. To attempt to reestablish black bear (Ursus americanus) populations in the central Appalachians, two reintroductions using small founder groups occurred during the 1990s in the Big South Fork area along the Kentucky-Tennessee border (BSF) and in the Jefferson National Forest along the Kentucky-Virginia border (KVP). My objectives were to estimate demographic and genetic parameters, and to evaluate long-term viability and reintroduction success for the KVP and BSF black bear populations. The KVP grew rapidly to 317–751 bears with a significantly female-biased sex ratio by 2013. Spatially explicit capture-recapture models suggested KVP recolonization may continue to the southwest and northeast along linear mountain ridges. Based on radio-monitoring during 2010–2014, high adult female survival and moderate mean litter sizes were estimated in both populations. All mortality was anthropogenic and males were 4.13 times more likely to die than females. Two-cub litters were most probable in the BSF, whereas the KVP had similar probabilities of twoand three-cub litters. The average annual mortality that occurred during the study period was sustainable and allowed for moderate growth (λKVP = 1.10; λBSF = 1.13). Continued mortality at the higher 2015 rate, however, resulted in probabilities of ≥25% population decline over 10 years of 0.52–0.53 and 0.97–0.98 in the KVP and BSF, respectively. Rapid population growth during the 13–17 years post-reintroduction and the overlapping generations inherent to bears retained genetic diversity. Cumulative findings indicated both reintroductions were successful at establishing viable, self-sustaining populations over the long-term. The anthropogenic mortality rate during 2015, if sustained, could cause precipitous declines in these populations. Reimplementation of annual vital rate monitoring and conservative harvests should be considered. Connectivity may be established between these two reintroduced black bear populations if growth and recolonization continue.

AB  - <jats:p>Translocation of animals into formerly occupied habitat is a key element of the recovery plan for Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae), which are state (California) and federally listed as endangered. However, implementing Sierra bighorn translocations is a significant conservation challenge because of the small size of the extant population and the limited number of herds available to donate translocation stock. One such herd, the Mt. Langley herd, recently became unusable as a translocation source following a substantial population decline. At the time of listing in 1999, predation by mountain lions (Puma concolor; hereafter lion) was considered a primary threat to Sierra bighorn, and since then lion predation may have continued to limit the ability of source herds to provide translocation stock. We evaluated the relationship between lion predation and ewe survival rates within three source herds of the Southern Recovery Unit, compared lion abundance and ewe survival among years of varying predation levels, provided a range of estimated times for the Mt. Langley herd to recover to its former status as a translocation source, and determined if the rates lions have been removed to mitigate Sierra bighorn predation exceeded sustainable harvest guidelines. We found compelling evidence that lion predation has impeded the recovery of Sierra bighorn by reducing survival rates of adult ewes (and consequently, population growth) and by preying upon individuals that could have otherwise been translocated. Ewe survival was poor during years of extreme predation but even during years of typical predation, survival rates were below a level needed to ensure population growth, indicating that years with little or no lion predation may be necessary for the population to grow and meet recovery goals. Because the intensity of predation was related to lion abundance, monitoring lion populations could provide managers with advance warning of periods of extreme predation. We found that following a period of particularly extreme predation, the Mt. Langley herd decreased in abundance far below the threshold needed to be considered a source of translocation stock, resulting in the loss of approximately 25% of the recovery program’s capacity for translocations. It is unclear how many years it will take for this herd to recover, but management actions to reduce lion predation are likely needed for this herd to grow to a size that can afford to donate individuals to translocation efforts in the near future, even when optimistic growth rates are assumed. We found that lion removal may also be needed to prevent predation from leading to Sierra bighorn population decline. Lion removal rates that have been implemented thus far are well below what would be needed to reduce the abundance the eastern Sierra lion population itself. We recommend continued monitoring of Sierra bighorn and sympatric lions and note that lion removal may be required to facilitate bighorn recovery for the foreseeable future.</jats:p>

AB  - In marine and terrestrial ecosystems, organisms are affected by environmental variations that cause fluctuations in population size. The harvest–interaction hypothesis predicts that environmentally induced fluctuations in population size are magnified by harvesting. Empirical evidence is urgently needed in the context of global change because greater fluctuations will increase extinction risk.     Here, we review theoretical and empirical work that has addressed the harvest–interaction hypothesis in fish, birds and mammals. We identify the mechanisms by which harvesting might make population size more variable over time and thereby increase the risk of extinction.     Theoretical models show that harvest can modify population structure in time and space, and that changes in the amplitude and synchrony of population dynamics both increase extinction risk. Empirical evidence indicates that fishing amplifies the effects of environmental changes on the population variability, but no empirical study of terrestrial species has tested for amplified environmentally induced fluctuations due to hunting.     Synthesis and applications. In terrestrial species, theoretical studies have evaluated how environmentally induced fluctuations in population size are magnified by different harvest strategies, but there is now an urgent need for an empirical evaluation of this hypothesis. Future research is needed to explore how hunting and climate interact and to test whether hunting enhances environmentally induced fluctuations in population numbers of terrestrial species

AB  - The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, is a common and conspicuous migratory species, with an extensive distribution across sub-Saharan Africa, yet hunting and habitat loss are thought to be resulting in decline in some areas. Eidolon helvum is also a known reservoir for potentially zoonotic viruses. Despite E. helvum's importance, ecological and behavioural traits are poorly described for this species. Here we present extensive data on the distribution, migration patterns, roost size, age and sex composition of 29 E. helvum roosts from nine countries across tropical Africa, including roosts not previously described in the literature. Roost age and sex composition were dependent on timing of sampling relative to the annual birth pulse. Rather than a single ‘breeding season’ as is frequently reported for this species, regional asynchrony of reproductive timing was observed across study sites (with birth pulses variably starting in March, April, September, November or December). Considered together with its genetic panmixia, we conclude that the species has a fluid, fission-fusion social structure, resulting in different roost ‘types’ at different times of the year relative to seasonal reproduction. Bat-human interactions also varied across the species' geographical range. In the absence of significant hunting, large urban colonies were generally tolerated, yet in regions with high hunting pressure, bats tended to roost in remote or protected sites. The extensive quantitative and qualitative data presented in this manuscript are also valuable for a wide range of studies and provide an historical snapshot as its populations become increasingly threatened.

AB  - <jats:p>In a subarctic forest at Kvaløya, northern Norway, willow grouse <jats:italic>Lagopus lagopus</jats:italic> fed at snow level by clipping bits of twigs from mountain birch <jats:italic>Betula pubescens</jats:italic> during winter. Birch has two types of twigs ending in a terminal bud: long twigs with a smooth bark, and short twigs with rings of thicker bark. The grouse selected ringed twigs above smooth twigs despite a surplus of smooth twigs in the forest. Ringed twigs had more bark cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of twig length and a higher relative bark/wood ratio than smooth twigs. Smooth twigs had growth nodes that increased in diameter inwards from the tip. Because of the non‐linear relation between the area and the circumference of a circle, the bark/wood ratio decreased for each node. Although being able to clip much thicker twigs, 90% of smooth twigs clipped by grouse were ≤ 2 mm in diameter. It is concluded that willow grouse fed optimally on birch in winter by selecting twigs to minimize fibrous wood intake.</jats:p>

AB  - Quantifying avian collisions with power lines at large spatial scales is difficult, but such mortality is of serious conservation concern for many bird species worldwide. To investigate effects on the Endangered Ludwig's Bustard Neotis ludwigii and two other bustard species, mortality surveys were conducted quarterly along high-voltage transmission lines at five sites (total length 252 km) across the Karoo for two years and one low-voltage distribution line site (95 km) for one year. Thirty bird species were found, with Ludwig's Bustards comprising 69% and other bustards a further 18% of carcasses (n=679 birds). Significant explanatory variables of Ludwig's Bustard collisions were season (collisions more likely in winter), rainfall (less likely in drier areas) and year on transmission lines (highlighting variability between years). Season and proximity to roads were significant variables on distribution lines, with collisions more likely during winter and away from roads. Ludwig's Bustard collision rates (corrected for survey biases) were higher on transmission (1.12 (95% CI 0.40-2.58) bustards/km/yr) than on distribution lines (0.86 (95% CI 0.30-1.96)), but these smaller lines are four times as extensive in South Africa so probably kill more birds. Despite being much less abundant, Kori Bustards Ardeotis kori were the second most commonly recovered species, with collision rates of 0.10 (95% CI 0.05-0.19) on transmission lines in the Nama Karoo alone. Collision rates are highly variable, but suggest mortality suffered by these two species is worryingly high. This adds to growing concern about the impacts of power lines on bustards globally, so given ongoing expansion to the power grid, collision mitigation measures should be implemented at all new power lines.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have revealed that adaptive microevolution (i.e., allele frequency changes through time) and behavioral changes occur rapidly enough to affect contemporary ecological dynamics, and we can consider rapid adaptation for better conservation and management of wild populations. However, previous studies tended to focus on adaptation that increases population densities (e.g., evolutionary rescue), and did not pay attention to adaptation that decreases population densities (e.g., evolutionary suicide). Here, we demonstrate that controlling trait adaptation may be potentially important for decreasing population densities. One possibility is introducing “selfish” genotypes to populations. If the genotypes increase their reproductive success at the expense of population growth (e.g., cheaters in subsocial ants or coercive males in damselflies), we can decrease population densities (intraspecific adaptation load). The other possible option is diverting trait values of animals from the value that maximizes population growth (ecological trap). For example, we may be able to change behavior of a deer population by hunting so that they will not approach the best habitat with ample resources (landscape of fear). Then, we can consider the optimal allocation of our effort to directly decrease their population densities and control their trait values. However, we should carefully conduct controlling trait adaptation because it may result in unintended outcomes through modified genetic compositions and behaviors, such as increasing genetic variation of the focal population that enhances adaptation to changing environments by introducing selfish genotypes or a transient increase of population densities by modified behaviors.</jats:p>

AB  - Habitat models provide information about which habitat management should target to avoid species extinctions or range contractions. The willow ptarmigan inhabits alpine- and arctic tundra habitats in the northern hemisphere and is listed as near threatened (NT) in the Norwegian red list due to declining population size. Habitat alteration is one of several factors affecting willow ptarmigan populations, but there is a lack of studies quantifying and describing habitat selection in willow ptarmigan. We used data from an extensive line transect survey program from 2014 to 2017 to develop resource selection functions (RSF) for willow ptarmigan in Norway. The selection coefficients for the RSF were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model fitted with random intercepts for each area. We predicted relative probability of selection across Norway and quantile-binned the predictions in 10 RSF bins ranging from low-(1) to high-(10) relative probability of selection. Random cross-validation suggest that our models were highly predictive, but validation based spatial blocking revealed that the predictability was better in southern parts of Norway compared to the northernmost region. Willow ptarmigan selected for herb-rich meadows and avoided lichen rich heathlands. There was generally stronger selection for vegetation types with dense field layer and for rich bogs and avoidance of vegetation types with sparse field layer cover and for lowland forest. Further, willow ptarmigan selected for areas around the timberline and for intermediate slopes. Mapping of the RSF showed that 60% of Norway is in the lowest ranked RSF bin and only 2% in the highest ranked RSF bin. Willow ptarmigan selected for vegetation types with dense field layer and bogs at intermediate slopes around the timberline. Selection coincides with previous habitat selection studies on willow ptarmigan. This is the first attempt to assess and quantify habitat selection for willow ptarmigan at a large scale using data from line transect distance sampling surveys. Spatial variation in predictability suggests that habitat selection in late summer might vary from north to south. The resource selection map can be a useful tool when planning harvest quotas and habitat interventions in alpine areas.

AB  - Impact of power lines on bird mortality in a subalpine area.— Four sections of power lines, amounting to 4,000 km, in a subalpine area of southern Norway were patrolled from April 1989 to June 1995 to record birds killed when colliding with the overhead wires. A total of 399 dead birds and bird remains were identified as collision victims. At least 24 species were identified among the victims, the majority only represented by a few individuals. Ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.), particularly Willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), made up 80% of the victims. Season, power–line section and ptarmigan abundance affected the collision rate of this species. The highest rate was found in winter, marginally higher than in spring. Few collided with the power lines in autumn, and none were identified as victims in summer. On average, the annual minimum ptarmigan collision rate was found to be 5.3 birds km – ¹ power line. The only parameter with a predictable effect on the probability of ptarmigan collisions was the height of the trees, as collision spots tended to be in places with low trees. Mortality due to power lines was, on average, at least 2.4 times higher than the annual ptarmigan hunting bag in the area during this 6–year study.

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Understanding bottom‐up, top‐down, and abiotic factors along with interactions that may influence additive or compensatory effects of predation on ungulate population growth has become increasingly important as carnivore assemblages, land management policies, and climate variability change across western North America. Recruitment and population trends of elk (<jats:italic>Cervus canadensis</jats:italic>) have been downward in the last 4 decades across the northern Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, USA. In Oregon, changes in vegetation composition and land use practices occurred, cougar (<jats:italic>Puma concolor</jats:italic>) populations recovered from near‐extirpation, and black bear (<jats:italic>Ursus americanus</jats:italic>) populations increased. Our goal was to provide managers with insight into the influence of annual climatic variation, and bottom‐up and top‐down factors affecting recruitment of elk in Oregon. We conducted our research in southwestern (SW; Toketee and Steamboat) and northeastern (NE; Wenaha and Sled Springs) Oregon, which had similar predator assemblages but differed in patterns of juvenile recruitment, climate, cougar densities, and vegetative characteristics.</jats:p><jats:p>We obtained monthly temperature and precipitation measures from Parameter‐elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and estimates of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each study area to assess effects of climate and vegetation growth on elk vital rates. To evaluate the nutritional status of elk in each study area, we captured, aged, and radio‐collared adult female elk in SW (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 69) in 2002–2005 and NE (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 113) in 2001–2007. We repeatedly captured these elk in autumn (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 232) and spring (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 404) and measured ingesta‐free body fat (IFBF), mass, and pregnancy and lactation status. We fitted pregnant elk with vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) in spring and captured their neonates in SW (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 46) and NE (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 100). We placed expandable radio‐collars on these plus an additional 110 neonates in SW and 360 neonates in NE captured by hand or net‐gunning <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> helicopter and estimated their age at capture, birth mass from mass at capture, and sex. We monitored their fates and documented causes of mortality until 1 year of age. We estimated density of cougars by population reconstruction of captured (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 96) and unmarked cougars killed (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 27) and of black bears from DNA analysis of hair collected from snares.</jats:p><jats:p>We found evidence in lactating females of nutritional limitations on all 4 study areas where IFBF<jats:sub>autumn</jats:sub> was below 12%, a threshold above which there are few nutritional limitations (9.8% [SE = 0.64%, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 17] at Toketee, 7.9% [SE = 0.78%, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 17] at Steamboat, 7.3% [SE = 0.33%, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 46] at Sled Springs, and 8.9% [SE = 0.51%, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 23] at Wenaha). In spring, of females known to have been lactating the previous autumn, 48% (SE = 3.3%, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 56) had IFBF<jats:sub>spring</jats:sub> &lt;2%, a level indicating severe nutritional limitations, compared to 20% (SE = 1.7%, <jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 91) of those not lactating the previous autumn. These low levels of IFBF<jats:sub>spring</jats:sub> of lactating females likely resulted from a carry‐over effect of inadequate nutrition during summer and early autumn. We found a positive relationship between summer precipitation and IFBF<jats:sub>autumn</jats:sub> in NE, and that IFBF<jats:sub>autumn</jats:sub> of pregnant females was inversely related to birth date of their neonates the following spring (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>1, 52</jats:sub> = 20.37, <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.001, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup><jats:sub>adj</jats:sub> = 0.27).

Of elk where we sampled femur fat during winter in NE, we saw evidence of imminent starvation in 3 of 21 juveniles (12%) with all 3 killed by cougars, and 2 of 12 adult elk (17%) that both died from non‐predation events. Birth mass was &lt;13 kg for 6.5% and 2% of VIT neonates in SW and NE, respectively, a mass associated with reduced probability of survival in previous studies.

We documented 293 mortalities of juveniles across study areas and years, and predation was the proximate cause of mortality in 262 cases primarily from cougar (<jats:italic>n </jats:italic>= 203), black bear (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 34), and other or unknown predation (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 25).

We recorded abandonment of 2 (1.4%) and predation mortality of 4 (2.7%) VIT neonates prior to being collared. We found 4‐fold differences between regions of subadult female and adult cougar densities (0.90–4.29/100 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) and 2‐fold differences within study areas across years, with cougar density lower in SW than NE. Black bear densities varied from 15–20/100 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> across our study areas.</jats:p><jats:p>We estimated survival of neonates to 30 days, 16 weeks, and 12 months using known fates models in Program MARK. Survival of neonates born to females with VITs was associated with cougar density, IFBF<jats:sub>spring</jats:sub>, and female mass but not female age or neonate birth date or birth mass. Survival was higher for juveniles born to females with lower IFBF and mass in spring, opposite of what we predicted. In a <jats:italic>post hoc</jats:italic> analysis, we found females successful in raising their neonate to recruitment were more likely to be successful the following year compared to those not successful the previous year, which may explain this unexpected finding. As cougar density increased, survival of juveniles born to females of known nutritional condition declined.</jats:p><jats:p>We conducted separate analyses of survival by region for all neonates captured to evaluate effects of climate, bottom‐up (but not maternal condition), and top‐down factors. In NE, juvenile survival was little affected by annual variation in climate but decreased as cougar densities increased and as birth date became later. For SW, survival was higher with less April–May precipitation and for later born neonates but less affected by cougar density than observed in NE. Across our 4 study areas, survival varied annually from 0.61 (SE = 0.08) to 1.00 during the first 30 days, 0.41 (SE = 0.11) to 0.90 (SE = 0.09) the first 16 weeks, and 0.18 (SE = 0.06) to 0.57 (SE = 0.11) through 12 months (recruitment) with survival higher in SW than NE.

We found that as rates of cougar‐specific mortality increased, juvenile survival declined (<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="graphic/wmon1039-math-0023.png" xlink:title="urn:x-wiley:14381656:media:wmon1039:wmon1039-math-0023" /> = −0.63, 95% CI = −0.84 to −0.42) suggesting cougar predation was partially additive mortality because the estimated regression coefficient was significantly less than 0 but greater than −1. We did not observe a similar relationship with rates of black bear‐specific mortality because the estimated regression coefficient overlapped 0, suggesting predation by black bears on juvenile elk was compensatory.</jats:p><jats:p>Our results suggest that recruitment in NE but not SW was primarily limited by predation from cougars, which was partially additive mortality. Given that we observed nutritional limitations that influenced juvenile survival in all 4 study areas, we were unable to explicitly quantify how much of the cougar predation was additive mortality. Thus, we caution that a reduction in cougar density may not result in an equivalent increase in recruitment, and maintaining or enhancing summer and winter ranges of elk in our study areas is also vitally important for sustaining populations and distributions. In SW, where cougar densities were lower, maintaining, and enhancing existing elk habitat may be the only management option to improve recruitment. Given the differences we found between regions monitored, basing management on an incomplete understanding of causative factors affecting elk population dynamics may result in ineffective actions to address low recruitment. © 2018 The Authors. <jats:italic>Wildlife Monographs</jats:italic> Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The Wildlife Society.</jats:p></jats:sec>

AB  - Populations declining toward extinction can persist via genetic adaptation in a process called evolutionary rescue. Predicting evolutionary rescue has applications ranging from conservation biology to medicine, but requires understanding and integrating the multiple effects of a stressful environmental change on population processes. Here we derive a simple expression for how generation time, a key determinant of the rate of evolution, varies with population size during evolutionary rescue. Change in generation time is quantitatively predicted by comparing how intraspecific competition and the source of maladaptation each affect the rates of births and deaths in the population. Depending on the difference between two parameters quantifying these effects, the model predicts that populations may experience substantial changes in their rate of adaptation in both positive and negative directions, or adapt consistently despite severe stress. These predictions were then tested by comparison to the results of individual-based simulations of evolutionary rescue, which validated that the tolerable rate of environmental change varied considerably as described by analytical results. We discuss how these results inform efforts to understand wildlife disease and adaptation to climate change, evolution in managed populations and treatment resistance in pathogens.

AB  - <jats:p>Scientists and wildlife managers implementing adaptive monitoring and management schemes, are tasked with providing predictions of population responses to harvest and environmental changes. Such predictions are useful not only to forecast direct effects of climate, productivity, land use, or habitat degradation, but also changes in the food web, such as expanding/�increasing species that are predators, prey, and competitors of populations of concern. Explicit consideration of food webs and their dynamics in more complex models could provide better predictions of future changes, and allow us to better assess the influence of management actions. Here, we present our perspective on what we have learned from conducting a number of case studies using such a food web approach with a focus on climate and harvest impacts and their implications for management. We found empirical support for many of our hypothesized food web effects, and were able in some cases to obtain short-term forecasts with slightly lower prediction error using models that account for food web dynamics compared with simpler models. Predictions are the foundation of adaptive management because they allow quantitative assessment of the effects of management actions; however, evaluating predictions requires adequate and high-quality monitoring data. Results from our case studies show that a combination of long-term monitoring and different types of study designs coupled with models of adequate complexity are likely required to better understand populations’ responses to environmental changes and harvest, as well as the consequences for food webs.</jats:p>

AB  - ptarmigan is considered a key factor for successful breeding of Gyrfalcons (e.g., Cade et al. 1998, Hagen 1952, Koskimies 1999, Potapov and Sale 2005). In many parts of Europe, Lagopus spp. often represent over 90% of the Gyrfalcon’s diet during the breeding season (Koskimies and Sulkava 2002, Nielsen 2003, Nystrom et al. 2005). Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) is the most important prey for the Finnish Gyrfalcon population (Koskimies 2005) while Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) is the main prey in Iceland (Nielsen 2003), and an important part of the diet in the high alpine areas in Sweden and Norway (Nystrom et al. 2005). This study, focusing on the spatial and temporal relations between ptarmigan density and Gyrfalcon breeding performance, analyzed data from 55 Gyrfalcon territories and ten ptarmigan census areas in Central Sweden at 63°–64°N between 1996 and 2010.

AB  - —We studied the dispersal of 14 juvenile Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) from their nest sites in an area of wind-farm development in the central Swedish mountains by means of satellite telemetry from 2005 to 2010. Their median age at tagging was estimated at 41 days. Their home ranges increased exponentially with time after leaving the nest. The median date for permanent dispersal >5 km from the nest was August 21, at approximately 40 days after fledging. The median size of the pre-dispersal home range was 266 km2, but varied greatly. Females tended to disperse further than males. The initial dispersal was non-directional, but eventually at least four birds reached the Atlantic or Baltic coasts. The risk of collision with wind turbines is judged to be highest in the pre-dispersal period when birds roamed within 5 km from the nest, which has implications for choice of turbine sites. The high collision rates of ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.) with wind turbines, the main prey of Gyrfalcons, found in Norway indicate that depletion of prey stocks pose an additional risk. The data indicate a high first autumn mortality, and the tagging technique is discussed in this context. Received 8 April 2011, accepted 26 April 2011. NYGARD, T., U. FALKDALEN, AND H.

As I read Miller et al.’s (2022) proposal to curb the harvesting of bumble bees for research purposes, even when done to work towards their conservation, my mind returned to my undergraduate years, when I enrolled in a general entomology course. I was in awe of the dozens of cabinets containing specimens from almost all the islands in the Caribbean. The collection also had an associated library with handwritten notes, letters, and field notebooks, as well as articles and books that used the specimens in the collection as data sources. The collection is an amazing repository that has continued to grow, just as the knowledge it makes possible continues to expand. There’s no doubt that collecting and documenting insect biodiversity can stir strong emotions in most of us that love and are passionate about entomology.

AB  - <jats:p>Long time series are important because they extend back to an era when animal populations were less influenced by habitat loss and climate change. Annual fluctuations in harvest yields are good proxies for large changes in population size and may reveal underlying ecological processes. From a variety of sources, we built a 142‐year long time series representing the mean daily catch (CPUE) of willow ptarmigan <jats:italic>Lagopus lagopus</jats:italic> in southeastern Norway. CPUE decreased over the 142 years, from approximately 35 birds shot per day in early years to around two in the last years. There were three periods in the time series: a first period with 3–5 year cycles of high peaks and low troughs (1872–1900), a short second period with similarly high peaks, variable depth of troughs and variable cyclicity (1901–1916), and a third long period with much lower peaks and faded cycles (1917–2013). Yearly variation in CPUE was best explained by an interacting effect of small rodent peak years and period, with a reduced positive effect of rodents in the last period, and a positive effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation index in spring and early summer. None of the weather variables with significant time trends explained any variation in CPUE and we could therefore not attribute the decline in CPUE directly to climate change. We postulate that a long‐term dampening of the amplitude in small rodent cycles combined with an increase in red fox numbers, have increased predation on alternative prey like ptarmigan, and prevented the populations from reaching their earlier peaks. Even though the present population of willow ptarmigan is only a fraction of what it was in former days, we recommend light hunting to motivate for monitoring and to keep public attention on the bird.</jats:p>

AB  - It has recently been shown that damped endogenous dynamics is a common feature in Finnish grouse species; In this paper, we demonstrate that time-variant harvesting may turn damped dynamics to quasi-periodic fluctuations. Exploited populations, e.g. grouse, may therefore fluctuate more than expected if we do not manage to keep the harvest fraction constant over time. However, the harvest fraction of Finnish grouse varies with the phase of the cycle. Such a harvesting strategy could potentially change the periodicity of the fluctuations, as can a threshold harvest strategy where a constant fraction is harvested above a density threshold. The two non-linear harvesting strategies investigated here can modulate the dynamic properties of the population in a way not predicted by linear models. We argue that the behaviour of exploited populations and the role of harvesting can only be understood if we identify and understand the interplay of endogenous and exogenous components of population dynamics.

AB  - Managing exploited species characterized by declining abundance, such as northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus and scaled quail Callipepla squamata, presents challenges for regulatory agencies and wildlife managers. Our objective was to determine the influence of quail abundance and quail hunter effort on annual bobwhite and scaled quail harvest in Texas, USA. We formulated competing models accounting for quail harvest at both statewide and regional scales using hunter survey and quail abundance data collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (1978–2012) and evaluated them using multiple linear regression and model selection (AICc). Statewide bobwhite and scaled quail harvest was best predicted by models that included quail abundance, quail hunter-days or total quail hunters, respectively (R2 = 0.969 and 0.915, respectively). Our most plausible models also predicted regional quail harvest reasonably well (R2 ≥ 0.67), but in some regions diverged from statewide models, with hunter effort alone be...

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Retention harvesting, or the approach of leaving live mature trees behind during forest harvest, is used in natural disturbance‐based management to mitigate the effects of logging on biodiversity. However, responses of many boreal vertebrates to variable retention harvesting are unknown. We investigated the influence of different retention levels in forest harvests on stand use by wildlife 15–18 yr post‐harvest using a combination of surveys of wildlife signs (scats, middens) and camera trapping. Site‐level measures of forest structure, including canopy cover, horizontal cover, tree height, tree diameter, basal area, cover of downed coarse woody material, and understory plant cover, were used to describe post‐harvest differences in habitats used by common wildlife species in northwest Alberta's boreal forest. Stand use of six species (black bear, coyote, fisher, red squirrel, wolverine, woodland caribou) increased with level of retention, while stand use of two species (grouse, snowshoe hare) declined with retention level. Retention level did not significantly affect stand use of five species (American marten, Canada lynx, deer, gray wolf, moose). Higher levels of retention characterized by greater canopy cover, basal area, and abundance of deadwood were associated with use of forest habitats by late‐seral species. Woodland caribou, a species of conservation concern, was detected only in harvested stands with at least 20% retention. Greater understory and horizontal cover characterized lower levels of retention being attractive for early‐seral species. These findings demonstrate the value of retention harvesting for conservation of wildlife species in boreal forest, while highlighting the challenge of managing forests for multiple species with different habitat preferences.</jats:p>

AB  - Ratio of immature (young of the year) grouse to adult birds (I:A) in the harvest of upland game birds is commonly used as an index to annual reproduction; however, I:A ratios can vary as the season progresses producing biased estimates. We analyzed I:A ratios in the daily harvest of dusky grouse (Dendragopus obscurus) and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in northeastern Oregon over 28 years (1981–2008) and found that I:A ratios in the harvest declined for both species as the hunting season progressed. We also analyzed ratios of adult female to adult male (AF:AM) grouse to determine if female and male grouse were harvested in equal numbers throughout the harvest season. We found that more males than females of both species were harvested, but that AF:AM ratio of both dusky and ruffed grouse did not change during most of the hunting season. Approximately 50% of the annual harvest occurred during the first 14 days of the hunting season. Therefore, we recommend using the ratios of I:A birds in the first 14 days of the harvest season as the best index to annual reproduction of forest grouse in northeast Oregon. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Campylobacter spp., especially C. jejuni, is the most common zoonotic pathogen in humans worldwide. In Nordic countries, the prevalence of C. jejuni in broilers, which is an important reservoir of human infections, is generally low. Thus, other sources of domestically acquired infections besides chicken meat need to be considered. Game birds are known to carry a variety of zoonotic agents, including Campylobacter. The aim of this study was to investigate Campylobacter spp. carriage in a flock of reared pheasants at hunting in two successive samplings to better understand the dynamics of Campylobacter infections in pheasants. Overall, 72% of the intestinal samples were positive for Campylobacter spp. by direct culture on mCCDA. C. jejuni was the only species identified. The isolates were genotyped using whole genome sequencing (WGS), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and ad hoc whole genome MLST (wgMLST). Two distinct C. jejuni clones were identified among the 18 isolates studied, representing MLST sequence types (STs) ST-45 and ST-699. The ST-45 isolates were closely related to previous human clinical isolates using core genome MLST (cgMLST). In contrast, the ST-699 isolates forming the dominant clone in the latter sampling were quite distinct from previously described cgMLST profiles from different hosts and sources worldwide. In conclusion, the intestine of reared pheasants is commonly colonized by C. jejuni and may carry genotypes relevant to infections in livestock and humans. Hygienic measures are needed to limit the spread of infection in reared flocks. Especially farmers and hunters having direct contact with pheasant offal need to be aware of the associated zoonosis risk to protect themselves and their working dogs alike. Biosecurity measures to improve the safety and reduce the zoonosis risk associated with pheasant farming should be further investigated.

AB  - Spring harvest is a primary mortality factor for male eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), but the relationship between spring harvest regimes and annual survival is not well understood. We banded 462 male wild turkeys from 1989 to 2007 in southeastern Louisiana to estimate annual survival and band recovery rates relative to spring harvest. We evaluated these parameters under a liberal harvest season (3-bird limit; 1989–1997) and a reduced conservative harvest season (2-bird limit; 2000–2007). Estimated recovery rates during the liberal season were 0.75 (SE = 0.05) for adults and 0.63 (SE = 0.04) for juveniles, and recovery rates during the conservative season were 0.61 (SE = 0.04) and 0.48 (SE = 0.05) for adults and juveniles, respectively. Annual survival averaged 0.16 (SE = 0.05) and 0.43 (SE = 0.05) for adults and juveniles, respectively, during the liberal season. Conversely, during the conservative season, annual survival averaged 0.31 (SE = 0.05) and 0.56 (SE = 0.05) for adults and juveniles, respectively. Our findings suggest that bag limit reductions combined with a reduction in season length contributed to a 2-fold increase in annual survival for male wild turkeys. We contend that male wild turkeys were likely over harvested on our study area during the liberal harvest season, which contributed to exceptionally low annual survival rates. Managers should attempt to assess survival rates of male wild turkeys in harvested populations to properly manage spring harvest and develop appropriate harvest limits. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The current harvest rate recommendation for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) in South Texas, USA is 20% of the autumn population, including crippling loss. This recommendation is based on population simulations of empirical data. We completed the first field evaluation of the 20% harvest recommendation by comparing prehunting and posthunting bobwhite density estimates on a hunted and nonhunted site in South Texas during the 2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2020–2021 statewide bobwhite hunting seasons in Jim Hogg County, Texas. We conducted line-transect distance sampling surveys on 4 occasions per year (early November, mid-December, late January, early March) from a helicopter platform and prescribed the 20% annual bobwhite harvest from the November density estimate. According to our bobwhite density estimates, we found that bobwhite mortality (e.g., population decline) varied seasonally between hunted ( = 54% ± 3%) and nonhunted sites ( = 46% ± 5%). Our spring density estimates on both sites (i.e., hunted vs. nonhunted) were similar through the first 2 years but diverged in 2020–2021, with bobwhite densities that were 129% higher on the nonhunted site. Comparing our annual spring density results to the means reported from population models (i.e., 100-year simulations) used to create the 20% harvest recommendation, we found that the mean spring density of the model simulations was higher than our mean field estimates on both our hunted (+59%) and nonhunted sites (+77%). We recommend a conservative approach to prescribing a bobwhite harvest in South Texas, such as using the lower 95% confidence interval of a bobwhite abundance estimate for calculating harvest prescriptions, due to variability within density estimates and bobwhite survival in semiarid ranges.

AB  - Abstract Fox Farm (1300–1650 CE) is a 16.2 ha Native American farming village in Mason County, Kentucky. The wild turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo) death assemblage documented for this site is suggestive of a harvesting strategy that differs from that of Fort Ancient villages occupied for shorter periods of time. Relative to those villages, the residents of Fox Farm killed twice as many male as female wild turkeys. By focusing on adult males, the residents of Fox Farm were able to maintain a sustainable wild turkey population in the vicinity of their village, which allowed them to live at this locality for more than 300 years.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Use of band recovery data combined with estimates of hunter harvests provides a foundation for estimation of abundance and population trajectory for a variety of wildlife species. We banded 3,141 Rio Grande wild turkeys (<jats:italic>Meleagris gallopavo intermedia</jats:italic>) during 2015–2021 and used band‐recovery data to assess annual survival and harvest, and to generate population estimates for male Rio Grande wild turkeys in Texas, USA. Our results indicated male recovery rate was age‐specific (adult = 0.095 ± 0.010 [SE]; juvenile = 0.036 ± 0.009) and adult and juvenile male annual survival was 0.49 ± 0.04 and 0.96 ± 0.14, respectively. Annual survival for adult females (0.68 ± 0.02) was lower than for juvenile females (0.98 ± 0.01). Female recovery rates were not different between fall and spring (0.017 ± 0.004; 0.013 ± 0.003, respectively) and combined harvest rate was 0.009 ± 0.006. Male population estimates, based on hunter harvest estimates, exhibited considerable temporal variation, ranging from 328,185 ± 66,313 in 2016 to 136,700 ± 27,621 in 2020. Using harvest average over the 7‐year study period, we estimated average male abundance was 228,709 ± 46,213. Female population estimates ranged from 895,556 ± 635,146 in 2016 to 409,889 ± 290,702 in 2020. We estimated an average female population of 561,578 ± 396,507. Researchers and managers should continue banding Rio Grande wild turkeys to assess long‐term trends and conduct additional work to confirm the accuracy of harvest estimates in Texas.</jats:p>

AB  - Wildlife managers on public hunting areas are accountable for hunter suc- cess rates, annual harvest, and wildlife population size. Understanding the effect of changes in numbers of wild turkey gobblers (Meleagris gallopavo) on harvest charac- teristics is needed. Population size and harvest characteristics were studied for 9 years on a 14,140-ha public hunting area in central Mississippi. Male wild turkey population size averaged 82, hunter effort averaged 455 hunter-days per season, and an average of 35 male turkeys was harvested per season. Hunter success rates averaged 7.7%, 2.1%, and 5.6% for all males, subadults (jakes), and adults (gobblers), respectively. For male turkeys released in the winter capture period (7 Jan-4 Mar) and subse- quently harvested that spring (15 Mar-1 May), harvest rates averaged 22.1%, 15.0%, and 35.4% for all males, jakes, and gobblers, respectively, from 1984 to 1992. Hunter effort was not correlated with male harvests (P = 0.198). Population size was corre- lated with hunter success rate (P = 0.053) and number harvested (P = 0.072). The population declined during the study and it became increasingly difficult for a hunter to be successful, and, in turn, hunter effort eventually decreased. Proc. Annu. Conf. Southeast. Assoc.

AB  - Background. Indigenous peoples have traditionally relied on foods hunted and gathered from their immediate environment. The Eastern James Bay Cree people consume wild game and birds, and these are believed to provide health as well as cultural benefits. Objective. To determine the fatty acid (FA) composition of traditional game and bird meats hunted in the Eastern James Bay area. Design. Harvested traditional game and birds were analysed for FA composition. A total of 52 samples from six wildlife species were collected in the areas of Chisasibi, Waswanipi and Mistissini, of which 35 were from birds (white partridge and Canada goose) and 17 were from land animals (beaver, moose, caribou and black bear). Results. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was the most common n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in all samples except for the black bear flesh, in which it was docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3). In white partridge, beaver and caribou flesh, PUFAs (mainly n-6) were the most common category of fats while in goose, moose and black bear flesh, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) predominated. In all species, saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were the second most important FAs. It would appear that in the land animals and birds that were analysed, the SFA content was lower and the PUFA content was higher than store-bought meats giving them a more heart-healthy profile. Conclusions. These results showed that the FA composition of game species consumed by the James Bay Cree population is consistent with a beneficial diet and that traditional foods should continue to be promoted among the Cree people to provide better physical health as well as social and spiritual benefits.

AB  - Abstract Several subspecies of wild turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo ) are managed throughout the western USA for wildlife viewing and hunting, including Merriam's ( M. g. merriami ), Rio Grande ( M. g. intermedia ), eastern ( M. g. silvestris ), and Gould's ( M. g. mexicana ) wild turkey. In addition to the variety of subspecies, the West also comprises a wide variety of occupied vegetative communities throughout an array of state and federal jurisdictions. In 1993, the Colorado Division of Wildlife published the Management Guidelines for Merriam's Wild Turkeys (Hoffman et al. 1993). Since that time, harvest and monitoring methods have evolved. Harvests are monitored through mandatory or voluntary phone surveys, online surveys, mail surveys, email surveys, mobile phone applications, field checks, and wing or foot collections. Populations are monitored through harvest indices, summer brood surveys, winter flock counts, winter classifications, summer classifications, presence‐absence surveys, camera traps, forward‐looking infrared, aerial surveys, telemetry, weather indices, citizen science reports, and a variety of modeling approaches. We provide a limited review highlighting the substantive strengths and challenges associated with each population monitoring technique to provide agencies and organizations involved in monitoring harvest and populations of turkeys with an overview to assist in selecting appropriate tools for use in their jurisdiction.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) was introduced to North America two decades ago, but for many species, including Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), the effects of WNV on individuals and populations remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest the effect of WNV on Ruffed Grouse might vary among geographic regions, depending on habitat conditions. We studied WNV in Minnesota, US, during 2018-19, in a region known to have abundant Ruffed Grouse habitat and a population cycling around a stable long-term average. We worked with cooperating hunters to collect hearts, feathers, and blood on filter strips from birds harvested in the fall to examine exposure to the virus. We detected antibodies to WNV or a flavivirus (probably WNV) in 12.5% and 12.3% of birds in 2018 and 2019, respectively. However, we did not isolate the virus from any heart samples, indicating that exposed birds were not experiencing an active infection of WNV at the time of harvest. Our findings indicate that, although Minnesota Ruffed Grouse are exposed to WNV, some birds mount a successful immune response and survive. However, our sampling approach did not account for birds that might have become infected over the summer and died, so it is unknown how much WNV mortality occurred before the fall harvest. Birds lost to WNV over the summer could reduce the number of birds that hunters see in the fall, thus reducing the quality of their hunting experiences. Management options for mitigating WNV impacts and other stressors consist primarily of providing high-quality Ruffed Grouse habitat that produces birds in good condition that are more likely to recover from infection.

AB  - If the set of papers featured in this Special Profile on Harvest ing is anything to go by, applied ecological research on harvesting is entering a new era. We have already left behind single-species studies that take neither space nor time into account, but we have been slower to consider the role of harv esting as a driver of change in an ecosystem context. Such an accusation cannot be levelled at this set of papers. The studies cover a wide range of taxonomic groups and geographical regions, from cockles in the Netherlands through a medicinal herb in the Himalayas to bats in the Amazon. A key lesson from these papers is that the ecological effects of harvesting cannot be assessed in isolation. Harvesting is one of a complex set of factors influencing the vital rates of harvested populations. As a prime example of this, Fordham et al (2008) show how pr?dation by introduced feral pigs Sus scrofa swamps the effects of subsistence harvesting of turtle Chelodina rugosa populations in Australia, such that popula tions without pig pr?dation can support a moderate harvest rate, while predated populations are predicted to decline rapidly to extinction. Watson et al. (2007) also considered the combined effects of harvesting and pr?dation on grey partridges Per dix per dix; in this case shooting had the domi nant effect on population viability, but it was confounded by the presence of captive-reared red-legged partridges Alec tor is rufa; the presence of the commoner species leads to density independent shooting pressure on P perdix unless harvesters explicitly avoid the non-target species. Indirect effects of harvesting on non-target species are the subject of increasing concern. In this Special Profile, Edman et al (2008) show that selective forestry leads to reduced abundance and fertility of two species of lichen in Canada, while Presley et al (2008) have a similar message for forest living bats in Amazonia; reduced-impact logging leads to a reduction in abundance of already-rare species, though it has less impact on more common species. Following the theme of the effects of fisheries on albatross species begun by V?ran et al 2007), Rolland et al. (2008) disentangle the combined effect of climate and fisheries on the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys. Importantly, they show that the relative effects of fisheries (both positive through feeding on bycatch and negative through direct mortality) and climate vary between the breeding and wintering sites it is important to consider the different seasonal locations of migratory species separately, as the pressures of fishing and climate may act very differently on population dynamics in each. This theme of spatial heterogeneity and the importance of considering the interaction between habitat and hunting is taken up by a number of authors this is clearly an issue that can no longer be ignored. In 2007, Wynne & Cote addressed the issue for spotted spiny lobsters Panulirus guttatus, demon strating that the effect of fishing pressure on lobster size and density is mediated by habitat quality. In this Special Profile, Gaoue & Ticktin (2008) show that the combined effects of pruning and bark-stripping from a valuable multi-use tree species, Khaya senegalensis, are more severe in the drier Suda nian region of Benin than in the Sudano-Guinean region. Presley et al (2008) also highlight the interaction between habitat type and response to forestry among bat species, while Ghimire et al. (2008) show how the effects of harvesting on the Himalayan medicinal herb Nardostachys grandiflora are more severe in low productivity rocky areas than in meadows. These studies are all empirical; from the modelling perspec tive, Ling & Milner-Gulland (2008) also look at spatial heter ogeneity. However, the modelling literature has not kept pace with our empirical understanding of the issue; their advance is to include space explicitly into the simple single-species population models that are still used for many sustainability assessments, and show how this small step towards realism is enough to alter substantially our predictions concerning the sustainability of harvesting systems. Clearly there is a long way to go before we can convert empirical findings into realistic predictive models of sustainability; Fordham et al. (2008) get closest to this in our Special Profile, while Rolland et al. (2008) recognize the need for predictive modelling based on their results to be carried out if we are to understand the implica tions of their findings for sustainability. Another key issue identified by our authors is the impor tance of considering indirect effects of harvesting on vital rates other than direct mortality. Gaoue & Ticktin (2008), Edman et al. (2008) and Rolland et al (2008) all address the effects of harvesting on fecundity rates of their study species, and all show that there is an effect in the case of Khaya senegalensis, for example, the main effect of pruning and bark-stripping is on seed size and fruit production. This is also a theme that the Journal of Applied Ecology has addressed in previous issues; *Correspondence author. E-mail: e.j.milner-gulland@imperial.ac.uk

AB  - Knowledge of effects of recruitment, oak (Quercus spp.) mast production, and fall-season format on harvest rates of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) is important for managers choosing to implement a maximum combined fall and spring harvest strategy. We used the ratio of fall:spring kill as an index to fall harvest rates and investigated its relationship to recruitment, oak-mast production, and fall-season format in Virginia between fall 1973 and spring 2002. We grouped recruitment (juveniles per adult female in fall harvest) and oak-mast production (no. acorns/sample) indices into above-and below-average categories, We examined fall-season format using 2 categories, a long season (>47 days) that was concurrent with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) firearms hunting seasons (1973-1994, n=22) and a shorter season (40 days) in which turkey hunting was separated from deer season (1995-2001, n=7). Fall harvest rate index varied with recruitment only in years with above-average mast conditions; no relationship was found in years with below-average oak mast. Fall harvest rate index varied among oak-mast production categories and season-format categories. Fall harvest rate index increased with below-average acorn production and with increased hunting pressure during concurrent turkey and deer firearms seasons. Changes in fall turkey harvest were related to changes in oak-mast availability. Oak-mast surveys may help state wildlife agencies better understand dynamics of fall harvests and may be useful in harvest management models that attempt to stabilize fall harvest rates.

AB  - Populations of wild birds and mammals are often harvested for sport, subsistence or commerce. Sustainable exploitation is an important aspect of environmental management and is critical to human wellbeing. However, our inability to sustainably harvest even well studied populations is often due to poor demographic data and a lack of understanding of critical biological processes. A key component of sustainable harvesting is the density-dependant feedback between vital rates (births, deaths, immigration and emigration) and population density, as this mechanism provides populations with the capacity to compensate for harvest mortality.     The aims of this thesis are to investigate density-dependence, compensation and sustainable harvesting in a traditional Scottish quarry species, the mountain hare, Lepus timidus scoticus, using a combination of replicated field experiments, cross-sectional studies and modelling. The mountain hare has been traditionally harvested for centuries and continues to be an important source of revenue for some land owners. Over the past decade the motive for killing hares has switched from predominantly sport shooting, to culling to reduce ticks and the tick-borne disease Louping-ill virus (LIV). Louping-ill virus causes high mortality, and can supress harvest, in economically important red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus. Sustainable management of the mountain hare is further complicated by cyclic, or unstable, population dynamics shown throughout their circumpolar distribution.      The thesis begins with a review of the evidence that culling mountain hares can lead to a reduction in ticks and LIV prevalence, resulting in increased red grouse harvest. The empirical studies follow with the aim of providing evidence for compensatory survival and dispersal, and density-dependent reproduction. Two field study approaches were adopted; the first was a live-capture and radio-telemetry study which compared birth dates, survival probabilities and dispersal distances and rates of different age and sex classes between two populations under different harvesting regimes (harvested and non-harvested). The second empirical study used a cross-sectional design whereby population density of ten independent populations were estimated using Distance sampling, which preceded hare harvesting. Tissue samples of killed hares were collected, enabling the effects of population density on female fecundity and juvenile recruitment to be assessed. Finally, an age-structure, female-only matrix population model was parameterised using data from the empirical studies. Sustainable harvest rates were determined as the maximum harvest that produced a positive population growth rate and an extinction probability of less than 5%. By manipulating age-specific harvest and initial population size, the effects of age-biased harvest and changing population size on population viability could be investigated.     Results of the cross-sectional study revealed evidence for negative density-dependent juvenile recruitment. However, this finding was not translated into compensatory survival in either juveniles or adults, although birth date of leverets was significantly later in the harvested population. Overall, dispersal distances and rates were low. Dispersal distance was greater in the harvested population, although when distance was scaled to account for differences in observation time, to give a dispersal rate, no difference was found. Projections from the matrix model suggest that 40% annual harvest rate is sustainable, although extinction probability increases with decreasing population size and as harvesting becomes increasingly yearling biased.     Overall, no evidence for compensatory survival or dispersal was found, although density-dependent juvenile recruitment was identified and may be important in population persistence under exploitation. Survival and timing of breeding may be influenced by behavioural and physiological effects of harvesting, or environmental variation, which may have implications for unstable dynamics of mountain hare. I identify and discuss key areas for future research aimed at increasing our understanding of the effects of harvesting on mountain hare population dynamics and demography.      In conclusion, we found little evidence that culling mountain hares can increase red grouse harvest, and therefore, cannot justify culling mountain hares for tick and LIV control. The low dispersal rates and distances, combined with limited evidence for compensatory mechanisms, imply that local blanket culls may succeed in reducing hare numbers with unknown implications for mountain hare population persistence and the wider biodiversity of the Scottish uplands.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii, a zoonotic protozoan parasite, infects mammals and birds worldwide. Infection in humans is often asymptomatic, though illnesses can occur in immunocompromised hosts and the fetuses of susceptible women infected during pregnancy. In Nunavik, Canada, 60% of the Inuit population has measurable antibodies against T. gondii. Handling and consumption of wildlife have been identified as risk factors for exposure. Serological evidence of exposure has been reported for wildlife in Nunavik; however, T. gondii has not been detected in wildlife tissues commonly consumed by Inuit. We used a magnetic capture DNA extraction and real-time PCR protocol to extract and amplify T. gondii DNA from large quantities of tissues (up to 100 g) of 441 individual animals in Nunavik: 166 ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), 156 geese (Branta canadensis and Chen caerulescens), 61 ringed seals (Pusa hispida), 31 caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and 27 walruses (Odobenus rosmarus). DNA from T. gondii was detected in 9% (95% CI: 3–15%) of geese from four communities in western and southern Nunavik, but DNA was not detected in other wildlife species including 20% (95% CI: 12–31%) of ringed seals and 26% (95% CI: 14–43%) of caribou positive on a commercial modified agglutination test (MAT) using thawed heart muscle juice. In geese, tissue parasite burden was highest in heart, followed by brain, breast muscle, liver and gizzard. Serological results did not correlate well with tissue infection status for any wildlife species. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection, quantification, and characterization of DNA of T. gondii (clonal lineage II in one goose) from wildlife harvested for food in Nunavik, which supports the hypothesis that migratory geese can carry T. gondii into Nunavik where feline definitive hosts are rare. This study suggests that direct detection methods may be useful for detection of T. gondii in wildlife harvested for human consumption and provides data needed for a quantitative exposure assessment that will determine the risk of T. gondii exposure for Inuit who harvest and consume geese in Nunavik.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                    <jats:p>Using data from the mid-1990s to the present, we assessed correlations of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) hunter cooperator reports from seven states to Breeding Bird Survey, Christmas Bird Count, and eBird data to determine which program’s trends best reflected patterns seen in hunter-sourced data that has historically been used for monitoring purposes. Christmas Bird Count data most closely reflected state-wide long-term trends in cooperator flush rates. Using an analytical approach that accounts for sources of bias and examines abundance at a finer spatial scale, we observed a pattern of decline across our study area. In recent decades, Ruffed Grouse populations in the eastern United States are thought to have suffered persistent declines due to a combination of young forest habitat loss and West Nile virus mortality. Declining hunter participation in much of the species’ range has highlighted the need to identify harvest-independent indices of grouse abundance to enable continued monitoring of regional long-term trends. Recent analytical methods can better capture complex trends in population dynamics, account for biases inherent to community-sourced data, and potentially inform designs of future survey efforts aimed at fulfilling priority monitoring and research needs. Comparable results across varying statistical methodologies suggest that our inferences are robust, demonstrating that Christmas Bird Count data can be used to inform regional monitoring efforts for grouse and other cryptic game bird populations, but require careful consideration of program designs and protocols to identify and implement data appropriately.</jats:p>

AB  - Relationships of temperature and precipitation to the reproductive success of blue grouse ( Dendragapus obscurus ) were investigated. Maximum and minimum temperatures followed similar patterns during the years 1976-1981 and showed no patterns relative to hatching success. Precipitation data, however, was variable. When significant amounts of precipitation fell during the last three weeks of the hatching period, chick survival and, therefore, recruitment were adversely affected. We suggest that precipitation occurring at the end of the hatch period reduces the September harvest of birds.

AB  - Red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) populations are currently declining in the Iberian Peninsula, mainly due to habitat degradation and hunting pressure. In addition, the release of farm-reared partridges may introduce pathogens, including parasites, to wild populations. The presence of digestive parasites in red-legged partridges hunted in fifteen Spanish provinces was studied. Fecal samples and gastrointestinal tracts were collected, analyzed, and the morphometric identification of parasites was carried out. Eimeria spp. oocysts, nematode, cestode and trematode eggs were observed in fecal samples. Adult nematodes (Ascaridia galli, Ascaridia compar, Heterakis gallinarum, Heterakis tenuicauda, Trichostrongylus tenuis, Subulura spp., Cyrnea spp. and Aonchotheca caudinflata), tapeworms (Raillietina tetragona, R. echinobothrida, R. micracantha, Rhabdometra nigropunctata, and Choanotaenia infundibulum), and trematodes (Brachylaima spp., Brachylecithum spp., Dicrocoelium spp.) were identified in the gastrointestinal tracts. Significant statistical differences were found among climatic regions in the prevalence and intensity of Eimeria spp. infection, median intensity and the prevalence of indirect life cycle helminths, with Southern areas always showing higher infection values. The study provides information of the health status of red-legged partridges in Spain, highlighting the risk associated with the release of farm-reared partridges for restocking purposes. This should be taken into account to improve management strategies for the long-term conservation of the species.

AB  - Identifying appropriate strategies for sustainable harvest is a challenge for many terrestrial vertebrate species because of uncertain system dynamics, limited data to inform population models, and potentially conflicting objectives that seek to harvest and maintain populations at desirable levels. The absence of monitoring and assessment infrastructure needed to regularly estimate abundance accentuates this challenge for many species, and limits application of rigorous state-dependent frameworks for decision making that are commonly advocated in natural resource management. Reference points, which define management targets or triggers for changing management, are often used to guide decision-making, but suffer from ambiguity when developed without explicit consideration of uncertainty or trade-offs among competing objectives. We describe an approach for developing unambiguous target reference points for assessment-limited species using structured decision making, and demonstrate the approach to develop target harvest rates for management of fall Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) harvests in the face of uncertain population and harvest dynamics. We use simulation and decision analyses to identify harvest rates that are optimal for accomplishing explicit management objectives in the face of uncertainty, and harvest rates with robust performance over broad regions of the demographic and harvest model parameter space. We demonstrate that population and harvest parameters commonly uncertain to wildlife managers interact to determine appropriate target harvest rates for Wild Turkeys, and that formally acknowledging a range of plausible values for structurally uncertain parameters results in more conservative target reference points than suggested by previously published studies. The structured decision making framework described here provides a natural conceptual and quantitative framework for extending our approach to develop unambiguous harvest targets for other assessment-limited wildlife populations while formally acknowledging structural uncertainty in system dynamics.

AB  - Abstract Grasslands enrolled in conservation programs provide important habitat for nesting game birds and waterfowl, but conservation grasslands have been targeted as a source of biomass for bioenergy and this could impact nesting birds. We studied the effects of biomass harvest on nest success and density using 109 blue-winged teal (Anas discors), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) nests found in southwestern Minnesota during 2009 (pretreatment) and 2010 (posttreatment). Grassland biomass was harvested in late autumn of 2009 with production-scale machinery. Harvest treatments included controls (0% biomass removal), partial harvest (50 or 75% biomass removal), and full harvest (100% biomass removal) from 8 ha plots. Nest success averaged 31% and was not influenced by biomass harvest. Daily survival rates were greater for nests located closer to wetlands. Estimated total nest density (0.42 nests ha−1; corrected for survivorship) was similar across harvest treatmen...

AB  - Recommended sustainable harvest rates for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) vary greatly and range from 25% to 70% of the prehunt population. Because northern bobwhite populations have declined across their geographic range, determining sustainable harvest levels is critical for effective management. Our objectives were to use simulation modeling to identify sustainable rates of bobwhite harvest, probability of population persistence, and minimum viable population estimates. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impacts of harvest on northern bobwhite populations in Texas, USA. We constructed a simulation model using Program STELLA 9.0 for a hypothetical northern bobwhite population on 800 ha in the South Texas Plains USA and modeled population dynamics to 100 years over a range of harvest rates (0–40%). A 20% harvest rate produced the greatest average yields (mean ± standard error = 231 ± 10 bobwhites harvested/year). Given a quasi-extinction criterion of ≤40 bobwhites (≤0.05 bobwhite/ha), a 30% harvest rate resulted in a high probability of quasi-extinction (PE = 0.75) within 47.8 ± 2.3 years. A 40% harvest rate was not sustainable (PE = 1.0), with quasi-extinction occurring within 15.5 ± 2.6 years. Harvesting northern bobwhite populations in the South Texas Plains at rates of 20−25% of the prehunt population should maximize long-term harvest while minimizing the probability of population extinction. Spring densities of 0.60−0.80 bobwhite/ha may represent minimum viable spring densities for northern bobwhite populations in the South Texas Plains as these are the densities associated with sustainable 20-25% harvest rates. Harvest rates >30% are likely to be excessive with respect to long-term population persistence for northern bobwhite populations in the South Texas Plains.

AB  - The contribution of country food to the diets of residents of Makkovik, Labrador, reflects the seasonal availability of different species on the northern Labrador coast. The nutrient density of the wild food component of the food supply varies from season to season according to the relative contribution of the various species harvested. In the summer, the level of calcium is somewhat higher than in most other seasons, reflecting the large contribution of fish. In early fall, the nutrient density for iron is the lowest for all seasons, and the level of calcium decreases to about half of that of summer. In late fall, the nutrient density of the country food harvested for household use has the highest density of thiamin, reflecting the contribution from the migratory birds, and the second highest density of iron, reflecting the increase in percentage contribution of seals. In winter the iron density is approximately twice that of other seasons. The level of calcium increases, reflecting the contribution from partridge and ptarmigan. In early spring the large contribution of caribou provides a high protein content, while for riboflavin it is the highest of any season. In late spring the nutrient density reflects the large percentage of fish. Dietary patterns of a population depending on country food for much of its food supply change from one season to another, and nutrient intakes also vary from season to season. These factors must be considered when evaluating dietary intakes and making nutritional inferences. Key words: country food, nutrient density, nutrition, Subarctic, Labrador

AB  - Abstract The ability to evaluate population trends through time is essential to successful conservation of wildlife. Directly estimating abundance of eastern wild turkeys ( Meleagris gallopavo silvestris ) is difficult, with few practical options for wide‐scale population monitoring. As a result, managers often rely on abundance indices derived from hunter harvest. Catch‐per‐unit‐effort (CPUE) is a commonly used metric which standardizes harvest totals and has been shown to track turkey abundance, but its use is predicated on an assumption of spatially and temporally consistent hunter efficiency. From 2015–2018, we surveyed avid turkey hunters in Mississippi to evaluate mechanisms driving harvest efficiency. We questioned each hunter about their demographics and behaviors, collected observations from their hunts, and used 2‐stage hurdle models to relate these variables to individual CPUE. Hunter attributes had variable effects on hunt outcomes. Hunter age had a significant positive effect on the probability of harvesting at least one turkey (an approximate 2% gain in success per year of age) yet was only weakly associated with CPUE of successful hunters. When considering only successful hunters, the percentage of hunts in which a turkey was heard, and the standardized index of total turkey observations were related to CPUE. Additionally, we determined the tendency for hunters to miss a turkey during the hunting season decreased with increasing hunter age. Our results indicate individual characteristics subject to temporal change play a role in determining CPUE and thereby have the potential to mask trends in abundance derived from CPUE data. Moreover, evidence suggested relative hunter efficiency was amplified when turkey encounters were fewer. Collectively, our results urge caution in use of CPUE as a surrogate for abundance estimates.

AB  - <jats:p>Few concurrent studies exist of sympatric gray wolf (Canis lupus) and coyote (C. latrans) harvest at far northern latitudes. Moreover, no studies explicitly examine effects of concurrent harvest on phenotypes of wolves and coyotes. We documented changes in sex and age characteristics and morphology of gray wolves and coyotes harvested by hunters near Ptarmigan Lake, east-central Alaska, USA, between 1998 and 2001. We hypothesized that the harvest would result in larger, heavier canids, reduce densities, and increase young to adult ratios in both wolves and coyotes. We generated von Bertalanffy growth curves indicating that wolves and coyotes of both sexes increased in length or weight until 2 or 3 years old. No significant changes in either mean length or weight or length to weight ratios occurred during the 3-year study, except that coyote mean length was longer over the last winter of study. Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for wolves ranged from 0.061 to 0.112 killed/day and for coyotes from 0.552 to 0.11 killed/day over the study. CPUE indicated that coyotes but not wolves declined in abundance. Changes in male to female and young to adult ratios did not differ significantly for either canid. We posit that coyote populations were disproportionately affected by the conflation of the severe Arctic environment and sustained harvest. Our findings will be beneficial for managing sympatric canid populations and for understanding demographic responses to density-dependent processes in wolves and coyotes, especially at far northern latitudes.</jats:p>

AB  - The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides habitat for grassland birds, but as contracts expire, some CRP fields might be returned to rowerop production. One alternative to returning CRP fields to rowcrops is to produce switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) for use as a biomass fuel. Because the biomass is harvested during the fall and winter, breeding birds would not be directly affected by mowing the fields but might be influenced by changes in vegetation structure resulting from the harvest. We evaluated bird abundances and nest success in totally harvested, partially harvested (alternating cut and uncut strips), and nonharvested CRP switchgrass fields in southern Iowa, USA, in 1999 and 2000. Species richness did not differ among harvest treatments. Abmidances of most species (16 of 18) were not affected by the harvesting of switchgrass fields, and strip width did not affect bird numbers in strip-harvested fields. Grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) were mole abundant in barvested portions of fields, and more sedge wrens (Cistothorus platensis) were recorded in nonharvested areas. The residual vegetation in nonharvested areas provided nest cover for species that begin nesting early in the season (e.g., northern harrier [Circus cyaneus] and ring-necked pheasant [Phasianus colchicus]). Nest success rates of grasshopper sparrows and common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) were similar to those reported by other studies in switchgrass fields and might be sufficient to maintain stable populations. In general, switchgrass biomass fields create breeding habitat for some grassland birds, and a mixture of harvested and nonharvested fields would be more beneficial to grassland birds than totally harvesting or partially harvesting all switchgrass fields.

AB  - From 1996 to 1999, we surveyed pheasant hunters in Utah to determine what factors affected hunting harvest and improved satisfaction with the hunt. We addressed each question by using a path analysis to examine the effect of select factors on hunter harvest and satisfaction, as well as how harvest affects hunter satisfaction. The resulting path analysis determined that relative hunter density, the number of roosters seen, and the number of pheasants harvested positively influenced hunter satisfaction. The number of roosters seen positively influenced hunter harvest. The number of hours hunted, the size of the hunting party, the number of predators seen, the presence of a dog, and the experience of a hunter with his/her chosen area did not affect hunter satisfaction or hunter success.

AB  - 1. Population cycles are mostly thought to arise through extrinsic rather than intrinsic processes. However, in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus), intrinsic male territoriality has been proposed as a driver of the cycles, possibly in conjunction with an extrinsic interaction with specialist parasitic worms. Here we examine how harvesting and environmental noise may also interact with territoriality to determine how grouse populations cycle. 2. A stochastic model of grouse dynamics based on the territoriality hypothesis is developed, including harvesting and the effects of nonterritorial birds on aggressiveness. Cycles are detected in 97% of populations simulated over realistic parameter ranges, and these exhibit similar statistical properties to those reported in studies of multiple grouse populations. As observed, cycle periods are shorter at higher breeding productivities. 3. The model demonstrates the destabilizing influence of delayed density-dependent territorial aggressiveness. Cycle amplitudes are higher when annual changes in aggression are larger and when nonterritorial males provoke greater aggression. Intriguingly, the model suggests how an interaction between aggressiveness and parasites may operate. It is known that males with high worm burdens show dramatic decreases in aggressiveness in the year following a peak in territoriality. When this is included in the model, via larger crashes in aggression, amplitudes are higher, despite a reduction in overall aggressiveness. 4. Environmental stochasticity interacts with territoriality to determine the form of the cycles, but this is mediated through its 'colour' or temporal autocorrelation. For example, uncorrelated white noise increases amplitudes, while autocorrelated red noise has the opposite effect. However, noise increases cycle periods whatever the colour. 5. Harvesting occurs before territorial competition. This reduces the pool of males competing for territories and so increases recruitment and population densities. However, crashes can then be more extreme so cycle amplitudes are higher. With harvesting at ~150% of current typical levels, which is within observed variation, the dynamics exhibit a sharp transition to a state where cyclicity is reduced, periods are shorter and amplitudes lower. 6. The model suggests that to understand regional variation in red grouse cycles, interactions between territoriality, productivity, harvesting and noise must be considered.

AB  - Harvest records are often assumed to offer an indirect measure of population abundance in huntable species. However, this requires population density changes are reflected in comparable linear changes in harvest rates. We tested this assumption for common snipe Gallinago gallinago, common wood pigeon Columba palumbus, coot Fulica atra, grey partridge Perdix perdix, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and brown hare Lepus europaeus in Denmark. If we consider hunting a form of predator—prey interaction, the annual kill can be viewed as a predator functional response to prey population size. Convergence of the annual kill to a type I functional response with similar auto-correlative structures in the harvest and count data would support the hypothesis that fluctuations in harvest and population abundance occurred with similar periodicity. The annual kill of common snipe showed the best fit to a type I functional response to the point count indices, with similar auto-correlative structures in the two variables. Othe...

AB  - 1. Changes in the abundance of populations have always perplexed ecologists but long-term studies are revealing new insights into population dynamic processes. Long-term data are often derived from harvest records although many wild populations face high harvesting pressures leading to overharvesting and extinction. Additionally, harvest records used to describe population processes such as fluctuations in abundance and reproductive success often assume a random off-take. 2. Selective harvesting based on phenotypic characteristics occurs in many species (e.g. trophy hunting, fisheries) and has important implications for population dynamics, conservation and management. 3. In species with no marked morphological differences between the age and sex classes, such as the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus during the shooting season, hunters cannot consciously select for a specific sex or age class during the shooting process but harvest records could still give a biased reflection of the population structure because of differences in behaviour between age and sex classes. 4. This study compared age and sex ratios in the bag with those in the population before shooting for red grouse at different points in the shooting season and different densities, which has rarely been tested before. 5. More young than old grouse were shot at large bag sizes and vice versa for small bag sizes than would be expected from the population composition before shooting. The susceptibility of old males to shooting compared to females increased with bag size and was high at the first time the area was shot but decreased with the number of times an area was harvested. 6. These findings stress that the assumption made in many studies that harvest records reflect the age and sex ratio of the population and therefore reflect productivity can be misleading. 7. In this paper, as in the literature, it is also shown that number of grouse shot reflects grouse density and therefore that hunting selectivity might influence population dynamics in a cyclic species. 8. The study is not only relevant for red grouse but applies to systems showing interactions between selective harvesting and wider ecological processes, such as age- and sex-related parasitism and territoriality, which may drive population fluctuations.

AB  - Abstract The common pheasant Phasianus colchicus is one of the most popular game bird species in Europe. In Italy their populations are commonly managed in order to increase the number of birds for the hunting season. For this reason we have analysed the effect of management strategies, such as hunting effort and land use and characteristics, on the number of pheasants harvested in 19 hunting districts (HDs) in Tuscany during 2001–2003 to detect the best strategies. Our results showed that, in addition to hunter density, protected area, number of wild pheasants relocated and year were selected in the final multivariate model which best explained the number of pheasants harvested. Restocking using wild pheasants captured in protected areas seemed to be of higher importance than releasing farm-reared pheasants. The key tool to sustaining the hunting pressure on pheasants seems to be correct management of the habitat combined with an adequate number of protected areas which can safeguard and produce wild phe...

AB  - Within boreal forests of western North America, the dominant large-scale natural disturbance is wildfire. Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period i...

AB  - Spring harvest rates of male wild turkeys (Meleagris gallapavo) influence the number and proportion of adult males in the population and turkey population models have treated harvest as additive to other sources of mortality. Therefore, hunting regulations and their effect on spring harvest rates have direct implications for hunter satisfaction. We used tag recovery models to estimate survival rates, investigate spatial, temporal, and demographic variability in harvest rates, and assess how harvest rates may be related to management strategies and landscape characteristics. We banded 3,266 male wild turkeys throughout New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania during 2006–2009. We found little evidence that harvest rates varied by year or management zone. The proportion of the landscape that was forested within 6.5 km of the capture location was negatively related to harvest rates; however, even though the proportion forested ranged from 0.008 to 0.96 across our study area, this corresponded to differences in harvest rates of only 2–5%. Annual survival was approximately twice as high for juveniles as adults . In turn, spring harvest rates for adult turkeys were greater for adults than juveniles . We estimated the population of male turkeys in New York and Pennsylvania ranged from 104,000 to 132,000 in all years and ranged from 63,000 to 75,000 in Ohio. Because of greater harvest rates for adult males, the proportion of adult males in the population was less than in the harvest and ranged from 0.40 to 0.81 among all states and years. The high harvest rates observed for adults may be offset by greater recruitment of juveniles into the adult age class the following year such that these states can sustain high harvest rates yet still maintain a relative high proportion of adult males in the harvest and population. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Surveys are used to monitor status and trends of animal populations. However, different surveys may give conflicting results for the same species and population being surveyed. Therefore, we compared results of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPW) roadside counts for scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in Texas. Surveys were compared on both an ecoregion and statewide basis. The BBS and TPW surveys gave similar trends for bobwhites and scaled quail for 5 of 8, and 3 of 5 ecoregions, respectively. Survey trends differed at the statewide scale for both species. We compared estimated statewide harvest as an independent index of quail population status in Texas with results from both surveys. The TPW roadside survey was more closely related to estimated statewide harvest for northern bobwhites (R2 0.86, P 0.001) and scaled quail (R2 0.75, P 0.0001) than the BBS survey (R2 0.60, P 0.001; and R2 0.35, P 0.0001, respectively). Survey methods, sampling frameworks, and issues of scale are important variables to consider when interpreting survey results. The BBS provides useful data on quail populations at a multi-state or national scale. However, most state wildlife agencies require surveys that provide information at finer spatial scales.

AB  - Abstract Harvest of upland game birds in concert with sampling of age ratios from wings can yield important biological information about populations. Although estimates of productivity are commonly produced, they are often not accompanied by a measure of variance. Thus, we developed standard error estimates for sample productivity ratios, compared 4 methods for creating confidence intervals for population productivity ratios, and developed a test and the corresponding sample size requirements for comparing 2 population productivity ratios. We applied these techniques to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) wing-data collected in Oregon, USA (1993–2005). Computer simulations indicated that backtransforming the Wilson's score interval on the proportion of immatures in the sample results in the most reliable confidence intervals among the methods considered. We recommend to managers measuring conservation action outcomes with productivity ratios to consider the appropriate sample sizes for the spa...

AB  - Stochasticities in population dynamics as well as uncertainties in parameters often make it difficult to obtain reliable predictions of future population fluctuations. Here we use a long-term data set to model the fluctuations of a Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) population in Central Sweden. We use this model to examine how different harvest strategies affect mean annual yield, and how these results are influenced by uncertainties in parameter estimates. Restricted proportional harvest (each hunter is allowed to shoot only a limited number of grouse per day) gave slightly higher mean annual yields than proportional threshold harvesting (harvesting only a fixed proportion of the difference between the estimated population size and the threshold when this difference is positive). However, variance in annual yield was reduced by restricted proportional harvesting because periods with low population size became shorter. Uncertainties in population parameters did not affect which strategy was optimal although those uncertainties strongly influenced the expected yield and the uncertainties in the hunting statistics. Inaccuracies in population projections are therefore important to estimate and to model when developing sustained harvest strategies for fluctuating populations.

AB  - <jats:p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Avian influenza virus (AIV) prevalence has been associated with wild game and other bird species. The contamination of these birds may pose a greater risk to those who regularly hunt and consumed infected species. Due to resident concerns communicated by local Band Council, hunter-harvested birds from a remote First Nation community in subArctic Ontario, Canada were assessed for AIV. Hunters, and especially those who live a subsistence lifestyle, are at higher risk of AIV exposure due to their increased contact with wild birds, which represent an important part of their diet.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloacal swabs from 304 harvested game birds representing several species of wild birds commonly hunted and consumed in this First Nation community were analyzed for AIV using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Subtyping was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sequences were assembled using Lasergene, and the sequences were compared to Genbank.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; In total, 16 of the 304 cloacal swab samples were positive for AIV. Of the 16 positive samples, 12 were found in mallard ducks, 3 were found in snow geese (wavies), and 1 positive sample was found in partridge. The AIV samples were subtyped, when possible, and found to be positive for the low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtypes H3 and H4. No samples were positive for subtypes of human concern, namely H5 and H7.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; This work represents the first AIV monitoring program results of hunter-harvested birds in a remote subsistence First Nation community. Community-level surveillance of AIV in remote subsistence hunting communities may help to identify future risks, while educating those who may have the highest exposure about proper handling of hunted birds. Ultimately, only low pathogenic strains of AIV were found, but monitoring should be continued and expanded to safeguard those with the highest exposure risk to AIV.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>

AB  - A basic rule to attain sustainable use of harvested resources is to adjust take to availability. Populations of red-legged partridges in Spain have decreased in recent decades, and releases of farm-bred partridges to improve short-term availability are increasingly common. We used questionnaires and bird surveys to assess whether harvest was related to availability of wild partridges or intensity of farm-bred partridge releases. We studied 50 hunting estates, including 6 administratively labeled as intensive (with few numerical and temporal restrictions to releases). In addition, we considered hunting pressure (number of hunters × hunting days/km(2)) and habitat as explanatory variables in the analyses. In intensive estates, annual harvest was exclusively related to release intensity, indicating that in these estates hunting is detached from natural resources and approaches an industrial activity based on external inputs. In non-intensive estates, harvest was affected by wild stock availability, walked-up shooting pressure, and habitat (greater harvest in estates with more Mediterranean shrubland). In these estates, releases did not increase annual harvest, and can be considered an inefficient practice. Additionally, the relationship between abundance estimates and harvest disappeared in estates with low partridge abundance estimates, suggesting possibilities for overharvesting in a large proportion of estates. Increasing the abundance of wild red-legged partridge through techniques like habitat management, and improving the adjustment of harvest to availability, may be a good strategy to increase long-term harvest in non-intensive estates. Additionally, Government and managers must create ways to segregate and label the estates where only wild red-legged partridges are managed from those where releases are used, to reduce ecological costs of management decisions. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Long-term estimates of abundance can be useful in elucidating wildlife population and hunter dynamics as well as other potential factors affecting populations. We used estimated vulnerability coefficients from a statistical population reconstruction (SPR) analysis (1996–2010), along with a 50-year time series of harvest and hunter-effort data to reconstruct a male wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) population in southeastern Missouri, USA (1960–2010; Gast et al. 2013). Following restoration efforts, the male wild turkey population in the Ozarks East turkey productivity region grew rapidly following a logistic growth pattern, from 2,932 turkeys in 1960 to 15,764 in 1980, and vacillated around a stable equilibrium from 1980 to 2010. Distance from St. Louis, Missouri, explained 19.8% of the variation in hunter density while turkey density only explained 1.1%, suggesting that factors beyond game density influenced hunter distribution. To explain the high inter-annual variation of abundance found in the historical reconstruction, we examined the relationship between spring weather, recruitment, and abundance metrics. A multiple linear regression found total precipitation in June to be positively correlated and the number of cold days in April to be negatively correlated with yearling male (1 year old): adult male ratios in the following spring. Our results suggest the current wild turkey population is controlled primarily by extrinsic factors through effects on reproduction. Evidence of a stable population with high inter-annual variation lends support for using consistent harvest regulations rather than altering regulations annually to accommodate short-term trends in abundance. Our research highlights the utility of SPR models to assess factors affecting historical wildlife population demographics. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Beyond organisms experiencing direct impacts (mortality) from the presence of anthropogenic features, interactive relationships may exacerbate the effects of anthropogenic disturbance within the context of these features. For example, mortality risk may be affected by the road infrastructure associated with energy development by influencing space use of predators including human hunters. To assess these relationships, we conducted research on northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus across a hunted and non-hunted area of Beaver River Wildlife Management Area, Oklahoma, using radiotelemetry from 2012–2015. We found that bobwhite mortality risk decreased as the distance from primary roads (m) increased across weeks (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.008, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0003 to 1.0013). The interaction between unit (hunted and non-hunted) and distance from primary roads was not significant (HR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.999 to 1.001) indicating that hunting pressure was not a likely explanation for the observed d...

AB  - In the boreal forest region, partial-harvest silviculture has been garnering increasing interest as a means of maintaining wildlife species and habitat structure associated with late-successional forests. If late-successional species can find suitable habitat in partially harvested stands with a given level of structural retention, then partial harvesting might represent a viable silvicultural tool for maintaining wildlife dependent on mature or old-forest habitat within managed stands over time. Here we summarize literature on the responses of late-successional amphibians, birds, and mammals in Ontario’s boreal region to various intensities of partial harvesting. We assess species responses from comparisons of habitat use in harvested and unharvested stands; we do not explicitly consider impacts of partial harvesting applied over large areas across the landscape. At the stand scale, light-intensity harvesting (70% retention) negatively affects several passerine birds, as well as spruce grouse winter habi...

AB  - A model was developed to analyze the long-term effect of the addition of a spring gobbler hunt on the dynamics of a hypothetical population of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) already subjected to a fall hunt of either sex. The random variables-the total annual mortality rate, the hunting mortality rate, and the immature:adult female reproduction ratio-were assumed to be normally distributed and to vary independently and randomly witin a range of three standard deviaffons either side of the mean while the simulated population reacted to the random changes in these variables for each year of the 100-year simulation period. Ite total annual mortality was assumed to fluctuate randomly within the range of 60 + 1S percent; the immature:adult female reproducfion ratio fluctuated randomly within the range of 3.025 + 0.75 young per adult female. All random variables were assumed to be independent of popuIation size. Ite fall harvest was assumed to be part of, not additive te, the total annual mortality and to fluctuate randomly within a range of as + 15 percent. The spIing harvest of all xexually active (2 years or older) males was assumed to be additive to the total annual mortality; thus, the effect of the spring hunt was analyzed at its upper limit. The analysis suggests that when the reproductive attainment is adequate to ensure a self-sustaining population, liberalized spring hunting of gobblers is biologically innocuous, regardless of ie short-term upward or downward trends of the population. The establishment of biologically sound and socially acceptable harvest regulations is a recurring problem facing all game management agencies. The long-term optimum use of a wildlife resource often is constrained by sportsmen's mores and agency conservatism. Both frequently result from a lack of information as to the impact of hunting mortality on the dynamics of game populations. The acceptance by sE>ortsmen of harvest regulations that enable game populations to be utilized more completely depends upon the wildlife agency's ability to present to sportsmen convincing population data. Thus, the capability of a game management agency to identify and assess the impact of alternative procedures for utilizaXon of wildlife populafions is of prime importance in attaining optimum utilization of our wildlife resources. lRelease No. 714 of the V;rginia Gooperative Wildlife Research Unit ( Virginia Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife Wildlife Management Inst;te, and Virginia Polytechnic Insfftute and State University, cooperating). Through population simulation, long-term effects of alternative harvest strategies can be evaluated. Also, inconsistencies in available data become apparent, deficiencies of current information are pinpointed, and research needs are identified. Thus, a feedback mechanism is provided for administrators who must deade between several alternatives of harvest and research possibilities. Highly complex models with many variables, traditionally intractable, may be examined with relative ease and in a short period of time. Simulation models of management procedures are limited by the assumptions employed, so the validity of the assumptions utilized in any population model should be given careful considera-

A complete example is given with valida tion, to show how it can be used for managing the Eastern wild turkey. The structure of the simulation system (micro Passim) is described, and the implementa tion of the model is discussed as an example of how the process-interaction simulation protocol may be used to represent a complex natural system. The model is designed to be used by state and federal wildlife agencies for exploration of the effects of potential hunting regulations on actual populations of game species.

AB  - Many current wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) harvest models assume density-independent population dynamics. We developed an alternative model incorporating both nonlinear density-dependence and stochastic density-independent effects on wild turkey populations. We examined model sensitivity to parameter changes in 5% increments and determined mean spring and fall harvests and their variability in the short term (3 yr) and long term (10 yr) from proportional harvesting under these conditions. In the long term, population growth rates were most sensitive to poult:female ratios and the form of density dependence. The nonlinear density-dependent effect produced a population that maximized yield at 40% carrying capacity. The model indicated that a spring or fall proportional harvest could be maximized for fall harvest rates between 0% and 13% of the population, assuming a 15% spring male harvest and 5% spring illegal female kill. Combined spring and fall harvests could be maximized at a 9% fall harvest, under the same assumptions. Variability in population growth and harvest rates increased uncertainty in spring and fall harvests and the probability of overharvesting annual yield, with growth rate variation having the strongest effect. Model simulations suggested fall harvest rates should be conservative (≤9%) for most management strategies.

AB  - Large areas of the British uplands consist of heather moorland, a habitat of global conservation importance that supports communities of threatened animal and plant species. Red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica are dependent on heather and benefit from management of habitat, predators and parasites by gamekeepers employed to create a surplus of grouse for sport shooting. We compared numbers of red grouse shot across nine British regions over four discrete time periods (1890– 1920, 1920–1950, 1950–1980, 1980–2010) using annual records of shooting bags from 272 estates. We examined whether trends in numbers of grouse shot may be explained by changes in keeper density, heather moor extent or replacement of moorland by afforestation. Grouse bags were consistently higher in regions of northern England than in Scotland and Wales, and declined in all nine regions except southern Pennines from 1920 to 1950. Bags in northern England increased significantly from 1950, coinciding with increases in keeper density. In n...

AB  - Ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus L.) habitat use was studied in the mountains of western North Carolina. In 1997, 9 stands on the study site were harvested via alternative regeneration methods, including shelterwood, irregular shelterwood, and group selection. From 1999–2004, 276 grouse were radio tagged and monitored, resulting in over 7,000 location estimates. Habitat use differed from availability in all seasons. Preferred habitats included gated forest roads, 3–20-year old mixed-oak, late rotation mixed-oak, and mature mesic hardwoods. Shelterwood and two-aged stands created by irregular shelterwood were among habitats preferred in fall, winter, and spring. Group selections were among habitats preferred by broods in summer. Use of alternative regeneration stands began 3 years after harvest and continued through study completion (6 years post-harvest). Hardwood stem density in alternative regeneration stands was within the range recommended for ruffed grouse habitat. With proper implementation, alternative regeneration methods can create quality ruffed grouse habitat in the Appalachian region.

AB  - Harvest estimation is a central part of adaptive management of wildlife. In the absence of complete reporting, statishods are required to extrapolate from the available data. We developed a Hierarchical Bayesian framework tailored for partial reporting where hunting areas covered by reporting hunting teams are available. The framework accounts for autocorrelation at the national, county, and hunting management precinct levels. We derived and evaluated an approximation for the probability of harvest on non-reported areas under a non-linear relationship between harvest area per team and harvest rate. We applied the framework to reports of red fox (Vulpes vulpes), wild boar (Sus scrofa), common eider (Somateria mollissima), and grey partridge (Perdix perdix) harvest in Sweden from the hunting years 1997/1998–2019/2020. The approximation was evaluated and determined to be sufficiently accurate. We showed that accounting for autocorrelation in harvest reduced uncertainty and increased predictive accuracy, particularly for game hunted in low numbers and variably between teams. The analysis also revealed that hunting rate has a sub-linear relationship with a team's area for all considered species. Further, the framework revealed substantial differences across regions in terms of parameters modeling the distribution of huntable land across teams as well as parameters modeling harvest rates. We conclude that the framework is useful to detect shifts in hunting rates and/or practices.

AB  - Human harvests can select against pheno-types favoured by natural selection, and naturalresource managers should evaluate possible arti-ﬁcial selection on wild populations. Because therequired genetic data are extremely difﬁcult togather, however, managers typically rely on har-vested animals to document temporal trends.It is usually unknown whether these data areunbiased. We explore our ability to detecta decline in horn size of bighorn sheep (Oviscanadensis) by comparing harvested males withall males in a population where evolutionarychanges owing to trophy hunting were previouslyreported. Hunting records underestimated thetemporal decline, partly because of an increasingproportion of rams that could not be harvestedbecause their horns were smaller than thethreshold set by hunting regulations. If har-vests are selective, temporal trends measuredfrom harvest records will underestimate themagnitude of changes in wild populations.Keywords: artiﬁcial selection; sport hunting;time series; ungulates1. INTRODUCTIONRecently, it has become evident that exploitation canlead to artiﬁcial selection [1–4]. As humans oftenprefer sex-age classes or morphological traits associatedwithhighnaturalsurvival,harvestmortalitydiffersfromnatural mortality [5]. Thus, harvests may lead to evol-utionary responses in life histories and morphology[6], outpacing other selective agents [7,8]. There havebeen calls to consider potentially undesirable artiﬁcialselection in management and conservation [9,10].A ﬁrst step to avoid artiﬁcial selection is evaluatingwhich practices have undesired consequences. Asdetailed, individual monitoring is rarely available,attempts to quantify artiﬁcial selection in wild popu-lations usually rely on morphological, life history anddemographic data collected from harvested animals[6,11]. Harvest data, however, will not reﬂect popu-lation values if harvest is selective and varies inintensity over time, as may occur with trophy huntingand size-selective ﬁsheries. For example, the agedistribution of shot red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoti-cus) was biased by harvest intensity [12]. Similarbiases may affect temporal trends in morphologicaltraits estimated from harvest data. If harvest prob-ability is affected by regulations for minimum size,gear selectivity [13] or by cultural preferences, theaverage size of harvested animals should be greaterthan the population average. These biases have beenacknowledged [14], but it remains unknown howthey affect our ability to detect temporal trends inphenotypic traits.To test whether data from selective harvests can beused to detect temporal trends in phenotype, we ana-lysed nearly four decades of detailed individualmonitoring of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis)inapopulation where unlimited trophy hunting favouredrams with slow-growing horns [2,15]. We comparedharvested animals with the whole population. In mostof the province of Alberta, harvest of bighorn rams isbased on minimum horn curl (ﬁgure 1). This manage-ment strategy protects sub-adults but leads to theharvest of rams with rapidly growing horns aged 4–6years [5,16], before they obtain the high reproductivesuccess associated with large horns at ages 7–11[17,18]. Similar regulations for both bighorn and thin-horn (Ovis dalli) sheep, combining curl restrictionsand unlimited resident permits, exist in most ofCanada and in Alaska. The ‘legal’ deﬁnition of a har-vestable ram is thus comparable to antler pointrestrictions often used for cervids [19].2. MATERIAL AND METHODS

AB  - This report describes contemporary subsistence uses of fish, wildlife, and wild plants in the southwest Alaska community of False Pass. Information about the history, demography, and cash economy of the community is also presented. The report is based primarily on research conducted by the Division of Subsistence of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. In November 1988, two division researchers interviewed 20 of the 22 year-round households in the community (a 90.9 percent sample) about their wild resource harvests and uses for a 12-month study period from November 1987 through October 1988. Previously, a division researcher had mapped subsistence harvest areas with several False Pass residents. The report also draws from published sources and from ongoing subsistence harvest monitoring efforts focusing on salmon and marine mammals. Presently, False Pass is the only permanent community on Unimak Island, the eastern-most island of the Aleutian Islands chain. Most of its residents are Alaska Natives who are descendants of the three regional groups of Aleuts indigenous to the lower Alaska Peninsula, Shumagin Islands, Sanak Islands, and Unimak Islands. These groups suffered severe population losses during the early years of the Russian conquest, when many villages were abandoned. Since the late 19” and early 20” centuries, after the acquisition of Alaska by the United States, the commercial fishing and processing industries have figured prominently in the cash sector of the area’s economy. In the 1987188 study year, the 22 year-round households of False Pass had an estimated population of 69 people, 84.1 percent of whom were of Alaska Native ancestry. A large majority of the community’s population (79.4 percent) had been born in the Aleutian Islands/lower Alaska Peninsula area. Commercial fishing was the dominant factor in the cash sector of the local economy of False Pass in 1987/88. Of all jobs, the most, 31.4 percent, were in commercial fishing. Commercial fishing employed 51.9 percent of the employed adults in False Pass during the study year, and 65.0 percent of the households contained at least one commercial fisherman. Commercial fishing provided 67.2 percent of the community’s earned cash income in 1987/88, and 61.5 percent of the total cash income. Involvement in subsistence hunting, fishing, and gathering activities was universal among False Pass households in 1987188, with every household using and harvesting at least one kind of wild resource. Of the total population, 85.7 percent engaged in at least one subsistence harvesting activity during the study year. These activities followed a patterned seasonal round, with late spring, summer, and early fall being particularly productive times of the year for subsistence resources, In 1987/88, subsistence uses were very diverse in False Pass, with the average household using 22.6 kinds of wild resources, harvesting 14.0 kinds, receiving 13.1 kinds, and giving away 9.7 kinds. As estimated in pounds usable weight, wild resource harvests for home use were substantial in False Pass in 1987/88. On average, households harvested 1,299.4 pounds, usable weight, a per capita harvest of 412.5 pounds. Salmon made up the largest portion of the total harvest (46.8 percent), followed by land mammals (mostly caribou) (19.2 percent), fish other than salmon (halibut, cod, Dolly Varden) (14.7 percent), marine mammals (harbor seal, beach-salvaged gray whale) (6.1 percent), marine invertebrates (octopus, clams, crabs, chitons) (5.6 percent), birds and eggs (ptarmigan, waterfowl, gull eggs) (4.4 percent), and wild plants (berries, other wild plants) (3.1 percent). Resources harvested in the largest quantities, as estimated in pounds usable weight, included caribou, coho salmon, sockeye salmon, chum salmon, pink salmon, harbor seal, and halibut. Resources removed from commercial harvests for home use accounted for 30.8 percent of the total home use harvest in the study year. Sharing of wild resources between households was extremely wmmon in False Pass during the study year. Every household received gifts of wild foods, and 95.0 percent shared harvests with others. As in many rural Alaska communities, a relatively small percentage of highly productive households in False Pass harvested most of the subsistence resources in the community, which they shared widely with , less productive households. In 1987/88, 30.0 percent of the False Pass households harvested 78.0 percent of the community’s total take of wild foods. These highly productive households were likely to be involved in commercial fishing, be larger than average, and own boats and smokehouses. The report reviews harvests and uses of each category of subsistence resources in False Pass in 1987/88, including harvest areas, methods of harvests, and methods of preservation and preparation. Updated harvest data are reported for subsistence salmon and marine mammals based on ongoing harvest monitoring programs. The final chapter of the report compares subsistence harvests and uses in False Pass in 1987/88 with those of other communities of the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian/Pribilof Islands. Subsistence harvests in False Pass are similar in size, scope, and composition to those of other small, predominately Alaska Native communities of this region, such as Perryville, lvanof Bay, Akutan, Nikolski, and Atka. They are larger and more diverse than those of the larger communities of the region, such as Sand Point, King Cove, and Unalaska. Typical of many communities of this region is the removal of resources from commercial catches for a significant percentage of the total harvest for home use (30.8 percent at False Pass). The report concludes that subsistence harvests and uses in False Pass remain a vital sector of the mixed subsistence/cash economy of the community and a foundation of its way of life.

AB  - Abstract: We compared survival rates of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo sylvestris) gobblers in hunted (Crackerneck Wildlife Management Area and Ecological reserve [CWMA]) and unhunted (Savannah River Site [SRS]) populations in South Carolina to assess impact of spring gobbler-only hunts. Annual survival rate of gobblers on SRS (0.71) was greater (χ2 = 5.11; df = 1; P = 0.02) than that of gobblers on CWMA (0.54). Our results indicate that spring gobbler harvests constitute additive mortality to turkey populations. However, even in years when reproductive rates were relatively low, a spring-only gobbler harvest rate of 25% appeared to have a minimal effect on turkey populations.

AB  - Understanding the effects of harvest on wildlife populations is fundamental to theoretical wildlife science and applied wildlife management. Demographic compensation plays a key role in models of wildlife population dynamics and in developing harvest strategies. The degree and form of compensation in a given population depend on its particular ecological and life-history characteristics and the timing and magnitude of harvest. Consequently, substantial variation exists in compensatory potential among populations, and it cannot be assumed that a particular population is capable of compensating for harvest. This underscores the importance of population-specific assessments of responses to harvest. We examined the hypothesis that concentrated hunting pressure in road-accessible areas reduces subsequent breeding season densities of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), in Alaska, USA, 2014-2015. We estimated breeding season densities of ptarmigan territories at sites within hunted access corridors and at remote sites with little or no hunting pressure. Estimated densities were substantially higher at remote sites (5.3-5.8 territories/km(2)) than at accessible sites (1.8-3.7 territories/km(2)). Two habitat-proxy covariates, distance to water and elevation (modeled as smoothed effects), exhibited strong associations with the density of ptarmigan territories. These results suggest a possible additive effect of spatially concentrated harvest on local breeding densities.

AB  - Hunters that have options to hunt in different areas should evaluate their previous hunting success when they decide where to hunt. Following optimal foraging theory for non-human predators, we investigated if hunting success and density of other hunters on the hunting area will affect the probability of return to the same area, and if such behavioural changes will result in a higher hunting success compared to hunters that change to a new area. For this purpose, we used detailed information about willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) hunters on state-owned land in Sweden. We found support for the optimal foraging theory application on grouse hunters' behavioural changes according to hunting success. The return rate increased with increasing hunting success, and hunters that returned to the same area also increased their success compared to hunters that changed to a new area. Only one third of the hunters returned to the same area the subsequent year. We also found a negative effect of density of hunters in an area on hunters' return rates and their hunting success, suggesting crowding among Swedish grouse hunters.

AB  - Hunting for willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) is a popular recreational activity in Norway, but studies of the hunters are limited. While large game management in Norway is based on sound models and research, management of small game hunters and hunting have not been subject to the same rigour. Compared to the extensive body of knowledge about ptarmigan behaviour and habitat preferences, the knowledge base on ptarmigan hunters is very limited. We surveyed the habitat preferences of 3,056 hunters to identify preferred landscape categories using pictures covering a range of landscape types. We also examined to which extent residence types and forms of hunting were related to habitat preferences. Through factor analysis, we identified three categories of hunting habitat; mountain forest, low alpine and high alpine. Mode of hunting is more important than residence status in terms of preferred habitat. Hunters using dogs preferred mountain forest and low alpine habitats more than hunters without dogs. Hunters without dogs had a higher preference than dog hunters for high alpine habitats. Hunters with mixed modes of hunting have wider habitat preferences. Residence status only affects the perception of the mountain forest habitat. The results may have implications for management as land use and place-based meanings are currently changing in many natural and rural landscapes, and hunting needs to be integrated with other recreational uses.

AB  - Understanding demographic mechanisms is key to managing animal populations, both in conservation and game management. We examine which life-stages contributed most to population growth in a recovering red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica population following restoration of management aimed at resuming economically viable harvesting. Demographic parameters derived from biannual grouse counts and from radio-tagged individuals were analysed using 'standard demographic accounting'. When parameter estimates were based on counts, a combination of adult summer and winter survival appeared to contribute most to population change. When based on radio-tagged birds, deemed more reliable because of independence between parameters and years, adult summer survival and chick survival contributed most to population change. The contributions of clutch size, nesting success (i.e. the proportion of nests with >= 1 egg hatching) and hatching success (proportion of eggs hatching in successful nests) were negligible. Overall, the survival rate of adults and chicks contributed most to annual population change and reduced the rate of population recovery. Analysis of grouse carcasses found that 82% were associated with signs of predation or scavenging by raptors. Rates of juvenile production exceeded those of adult mortality, allowing modest population growth, but insufficient to resume economically viable harvesting.

AB  - Supplementary feeding of wild red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa with wheat is a widespread management practice in hunting areas in Spain. Many studies note that energetic diets affect the physiology of hand-reared galliforms. In order to assess if cereal supply might also affect wild birds, we studied the weight of the heart, spleen and liver, and the length of the small intestine and caecum of 129 wild red-legged partridges from three hunting estates where wheat is supplied, and compared it with 67 partridges from two non-supplied estates. Non-supplied partridges had heavier hearts (9%, both in juveniles and adults), and longer caeca (20% in juveniles and 14% in adults) than supplemented birds. An excessive intake of energy-rich items, such as the wheat supplied, instead of fibre-rich or proteic natural food, might explain the differences found. The management implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - (1)  The effect of predation by hen harrier (Circus cyaneus L.) on the breeding success of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus Lath.) was examined on managed moorland in Scotland.        (2)  Extensive studies of breeding success on pairs of moors indicated that moors with breeding harriers produced an average of 17% fewer young grouse.  On one pair of moors losses varied positively with harrier density over 3 years.        (3)  On intensive study areas, grouse brood size was measured 2 weeks after hatching and 6 weeks later.  Harriers were observed hunting during this period and a figure for expected chick losses obtained.  Over the 3 years harrier predation accounted for 91% of observed losses in the 6 weeks.        (4)  Prey was examined at three harrier nests in 1988.  Of 299 items identified, 32% were grouse chicks, although there were significant differences among nests.        (5)  Data from this and other studies of hen harrier diet were collated.  The relationship between grouse density and the proportion of grouse in the harrier diet indicated that grouse populations at low density are most vulnerable to high chick losses.

AB  - This review aims to compile the current knowledge of tetraonid population dynamics. As most of the grouse species in the world are game, long-term data often originate from hunting statistics. Many of these data sets show decreasing trend in population numbers. Environmental changes due to forestry and other human activities are the most obvious causes in this process. Some tetraonid species have populations which display both non-cyclic and cyclic dynamics of various length. Hence, cyclicity is not a species-specific property. However, most of the detailed population studies have been conducted in cyclic populations. No single factor has been found to explain the fluctuations. The possible effects of hunting on the dynamics are also explored. This is done by using logistic population growth model as a starting point and implementing various hunting strategies into it. The results show that, in most cases, the hunting pressure has to be high to change the original dynamical behavior of the population. It is concluded that better understanding of population fluctuations of tetraonids requires data of age-class specific mortality and fecundity, as well as of the direct and indirect effects of hunting.

AB  - Mountain hares (Lepus timidus) are regularly harvested on Scottish moorland managed for recreational hunting of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica). There are concerns that large-scale culls of mountain hares on grouse moors are contributing to population declines of mountain hares in Scotland. We use hare data collected during red grouse counts in Scotland, to consider spatial and temporal variation in annual mountain hare indices of spring abundance in relation to different grouse management intensities, classified as either 'Driven' (driven grouse shooting), 'Walked-up' (walked-up shooting) or 'Not-shot' (where there was no grouse shooting interest). Trends in mountain hare abundance indices varied with region and grouse management intensity. Hare indices were higher and relatively stable on moors where driven grouse shooting was practised relative to lower indices and declines on moors where grouse were either walked-up or not shot. Abundance indices fluctuated over time in a quasi-cyclical manner, fluctuations being more pronounced where hares were more abundant, i.e. on driven grouse moors. Density-dependent processes such as resource competition and parasitism could explain greater fluctuations in areas where hare abundance indices were higher, whilst reductions in indices over time probably reflect sampling at decline phases of the cycle, particularly on driven moors, rather than being part of true long-term declines. Given our understanding of grouse moor management and mountain hare ecology, enhanced habitat management and control of generalist predators seem to be the most parsimonious explanation for higher abundances indices of mountain hare on driven grouse moors.

AB  - The optimal harvesting strategies for unstable populations are explored using first discrete time models and second a continuous time model specifically applied to the destabilising effects of the caecal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis on the dynamics of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. In discrete time models, with overcompensation generating either cyclic or chaotic fluctuations in abundance harvesting can act as both a stabilising and a destabilising process. Maximum yields occur at the harvesting rate that coincides with the point where the harvesting stabilises the overcompensation. Optimal harvesting rates increase with the degree of overcompensation although these are more vulnerable to overharvesting. Harvesting in the continuous time model provides similar results, although observed hunting records do not appear to be stabilised by harvesting. Empirical data on the mortality caused by other natural enemies of red grouse, the hen harrier Circus cyaenus and the louping ill virus, show that these mortalities do stabilise grouse dynamics. One explanation is that both hen harriers and louping ill virus cause significant mortality to chicks before the infective stages of T. tenuis are laid down on the ground, whereas shooting takes place after the infective stages are laid down and thus do not stabilise the populations.

AB  - Studying the concentration of biogenic and toxic microelements in the body tissues of wild animals is relevant for organizing regional environmental monitoring, assessing the state of populations and ensuring the safety of meat and wild products. The studies were carried out to determine the content of biogenic and toxic elements in the organs and tissues of the willow ptarmigan in the north of the Krasnoyarsk Region, Russia, where different levels of technogenic pollution are expected. The iron, copper, nickel, lead, and cadmium content in the pectoral muscles and liver of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) (n=162), bagged during five hunting seasons in 2005-2019, were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. The levels of lead, cadmium and iron in the tissues were significantly higher in contaminated areas, while the copper levels did not differ. Element concentrations in liver and skeletal muscle in impact areas were highly correlated with each other. This may be related to common sources of pollutant emissions. Sex differences in micronutrient content can be determined by spatial differentiation of the sexes during migration, seasonal feeding patterns, and the specific birds' metabolism in reproductive period. Cadmium and lead content in liver and muscle tissue samples from impact areas exceeded current food hygiene standards, which may pose a threat to consumers. Probably, high levels of lead and cadmium reflect the increased content of metals in food items primarily willow sprouts and buds, which are the most important winter food for ptarmigan.

AB  - 1. Red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus populations in Britain exhibit cyclic fluctuations in abundance with periodic population crashes. Substantial evidence exists to suppose that parasitic worms are the major factor causing these population crashes.        2. This experimental study was undertaken between 1996 and 2000 on two areas of moorland in the north Pennines, UK, to evaluate the efficacy of the indirect application of anthelmintic drugs in the control of the caecal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis.        3. On one area, grouse were given access to anthelmintic drugs incorporated into grit (medicated grit) to control T. tenuis numbers, while on the second control area the birds had access to grit without anthelmintic drugs incorporated (plain grit). In the winter of 1998-99 the treatment was reversed between the two areas.        4. Adult grouse from the experimentally treated area had significantly lower infections of T. tenuis than grouse from the control area. Hen grouse, which had access to anthelmintic drugs, did not produce significantly more eggs or have a greater hatching success than hens with access only to plain grit. Chick survival was significantly greater on the medicated grit areas, with a significant difference in breeding success. Hens that had access to anthelmintic drugs reared more than twice as many chicks as control hens.        5. No significant difference was found in red grouse survival between grit treatments.        6. The increase in grouse numbers arising from the use of medicated grit enhances the viability of red grouse shooting because the cost of treatment appears to be low relative to the return from an increased harvest.

AB  - Between 1996 and 1998, ruffed grouse, spruce grouse, willow ptarmigan, and rock ptarmigan harvested by hunters in Quebec were examined for lead contamination. On examination of the gizzards of these birds, lead shot was found only in ruffed grouse (1.2%). The probability of ingestion of lead shot by grouse and ptarmigans is low. Analyses of the lead concentrations in the wing bones of grouse and ptarmigans and in the muscle tissue of ptarmigans were conducted. Although differences were observed between individuals based on age and sex, the mean concentrations measured were in the range of those that occur naturally at background levels (< 6 mu g/g dw). Lead concentrations in muscle tissue were low, often at the limit of detection. However, the few high concentrations detected were probably related to a lead pellet or bullet fragment. Based on an analysis of the health risk associated with consumption of ptarmigan muscle, we conclude that the use of lead ammunition for hunting gallinaceous birds may pose an unnecessary risk of lead poisoning because of the possible ingestion of lead shot, bullets, fragments or embedded shot.

AB  - Sublethal parasite infections may cause mortality indirectly by exposing the host to predation. Intestinal helminth parasites are common in forest grouse, the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, the black grouse Tetrao tetrix and the hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia, and these grouse are valuable prey for several species of predators. We evaluated the hypothesis that parasite infection makes the host more vulnerable to predation by comparing the intestinal parasite infection status of arouse hunted with a trained dog to that of grouse hunted without a dog. Cestode infections were more common in grouse hunted with a dog supporting the hypothesis. Cestodes were mostly parasites of juvenile grouse but even among juveniles only, cestodes were more prevalent in dog-assisted hunting bag. The results suggest that mammalian predators could prey more selectively on parasitized individuals and that intestinal parasites may contribute to the high mortality of juvenile grouse through increased predation.

AB  - A recent analysis of the mammal bones from Bluefish Caves (northern Yukon Territory, Canada) suggests that modern humans visited the site on several occasions for short-term hunting activities as early as 23,500 calibrated years BP. Here we apply taphonomic methods to the avian remains recovered from the caves. Seventeen genera of birds are identified in the assemblage, including 450 ptarmigan individuals ( Lagopus lagopus and Lagopus muta ). We discuss paleoenvironmental implications and show that carnivores and birds of prey (e.g., foxes, Snowy Owls) were likely responsible for most of the accumulation and modification of avian remains. Human intervention, however, is reported on one Snow Goose bone and possibly on ptarmigan bones.

AB  - Knowledge about how hunting pressure is determined, and the relative efficacy of different mechanisms to regulate harvest, can help to improve the managers' decision-making process. We developed a general framework about the decision-making process that regulates redlegged partridge (Alectoris rufa) hunting pressure in central Spain based on information from a focus group and individual interviews with game managers. We also used available information to compare the efficiency of different tools thus improving some decision steps. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different population monitoring methods as a way to reduce uncertainty on partridge availability to hunters. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between annual harvest and various regulatory mechanisms of partridge hunting pressure used in the study area to identify the most potentially useful one to limit annual take-off. Game managers usually set hunting pressure after a qualitative assessment on population abundance prior to the hunting season, but this decision was frequently modified during the course of the hunting season according to variations in catch or perceived abundance at that time. Our results showed that kilometric abundance indices (counting partridges from cars along line transects) was a simple cost-efficient and reliable estimate of partridge density (estimated by Distance sampling). A variety of regulatory mechanisms were used by managers. The variables that most affected annual harvest (in addition to partridge abundance) were the number of driven-shooting days, and hunter density in walked-up hunting days, suggesting that their adjustment will be the most efficient regulatory mechanisms. We conclude that adequate monitoring on population abundance should be a critical step for managers' decision-making, and that a better understanding of the relative value of regulatory mechanisms, combining social and ecological approaches, would help improving our understanding of any human-mediated system, thus leading to better management recommendations.

AB  - Leg and foot bones of adult and juvenile red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) were collected from hunter-shot birds on two Scottish estates (Glendye and Invermark) and one Yorkshire estate in September, 2003. The lead content of bones was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and corresponding stable lead isotopes (Pb(204, 206, 207, 208)) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. At the Glendye (N = 111) and Invermark (N = 85) estates, relatively few birds (5.4% and 3.5%, respectively) had highly elevated bone lead concentrations (>20 mu g/g dry weight). In bones of these highly exposed birds, a combination of Pb(206):Pb(207) and Pb(208):Pb(207) ratios was consistent with ingestion of lead gunshot available in Europe. By contrast, Yorkshire grouse experienced a high incidence (65.8%) of bone lead >20 mu g/g. The Pb(206):Pb(207) and Pb(208): Pb(207) ratios in bones of these highly exposed birds were consistent with a combined exposure to ingested lead gunshot and lead from galena mining in the region. Lead isotope ratios also indicated that lead from UK gasoline combustion and fallout from atmospheric particles was not a likely source of elevated lead in bones of either Scottish or Yorkshire grouse. Suggested management options for the three moors include adopting nontoxic shot for all game shooting on the estates, allowing heather (Calluna vulgaris) vegetation to grow tall in lead shot fall-out zones to reduce physical access to high densities of lead shot already present, and provision of calcareous grit across moors to reduce lead assimilation from all ingested sources of lead.

AB  - Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) hunting has long traditions in Norway. It is often assumed that hunters are more consumptively and less conservation oriented than other recreational groups. Considering the large numbers of hunters and the popularity of the sport it is more likely that hunters value both consumptive and appreciative aspects and represent diversity in their concern for the environment. In this study we surveyed 2,717 ptarmigan hunters to examine environmental orientation, and the effects of environmental orientation on different management regulations. Results showed that environmental concern is a discriminating factor for how the hunters rate hunting goals, harvest regulation measures, and acceptance of protecting parts of the bird populations in refuges. Increasing environmental concern is positively correlated with higher acceptance of regulatory management actions aimed at preserving the resource. Socio-demographic variables had limited effect on the relationship between environmental concern and attitudes toward management. Small game management needs to balance consumptive and appreciative experience dimensions, and degree of environmental orientation may be an indicator of acceptance of management actions.

AB  - Red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus populations exhibit unstable dynamics that are often characterised by regular periodic fluctuations in abundance. Time-series' of grouse harvesting records collected from 287 management units (moors) across Scotland, England and Wales were analysed to investigate the broad scale patterns of synchrony in these fluctuations. Estimation of the spatial autocorrelation of grouse population dynamics across moors indicates relatively high levels of synchrony between populations on adjacent moors, but that this synchrony declines sharply with increasing inter-moor distance. At distances of greater than 100 km, grouse population time-series exhibit only weakly positive cross-correlation coefficients. Twenty-eight geographical, environmental and other candidate variables were examined to construct a general linear model to explain variation in local synchrony. Grouse moor productivity (average size of shooting bag), distance from the Atlantic coast moving in a north-easterly direction, April and June temperatures, and June rainfall significantly increased the explanatory power of this model. An understanding of the processes underlying synchrony in red grouse population dynamics is a prerequisite to anticipating the effects of large-scale environmental change on regional patterns of grouse distribution and abundance.

AB  - Background: The grey partridge (Perdix perdix) and the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) are galliform birds typical of arable lands in Central Europe and exhibit a partly dramatic negative population trend. In order to understand general habitat preferences we modelled grey partridge and common pheasant densities over the entire range of Lower Saxony. Spatially explicit developments in bird densities were modelled using spatially explicit trends of crop cultivation. Pheasant and grey partridge densities counted annually by over 8000 hunting district holders over 10 years in a range of 3.7 Mio ha constitute a unique dataset (wildlife survey of Lower Saxony). Data on main landscape groups, functional groups of agricultural crops (consisting of 9.5 million fields compiled by the Integrated Administration and Control System) and landscape features were aggregated to 420 municipalities. To model linear 8 or 10 year population trends (for common pheasant and grey partridge respectively) we use rho correlation coefficients of densities, but also rho coefficients of agricultural crops.        Results: All models confirm a dramatic decline in population densities. The habitat model for the grey partridge shows avoidance of municipalities with a high proportion of woodland and water areas, but a preference for areas with a high proportion of winter grains and high crop diversity. The trend model confirms these findings with a linear positive effect of diversity on grey partridge population development. Similarly, the pheasant avoids wooded areas but showed some preference for municipalities with open water. The effect of maize was found to be positive at medium densities, but negative at very high proportions. Winter grains, landscape features and high crop diversity are favorable. The positive effect of winter grains and higher crop diversity is also supported by the trend model.        Conclusions: The results show the strong importance of diverse crop cultivation. Most incentives favor the cultivation of specific crops, which results in large areas of monocultures. The results confirm the importance of sustainable agricultural policies.

AB  - One-hundred twenty-three gizzards from upland game birds (chukar, Alectoris chukar; and common pheasant, Phasianus colchicus) harvested by hunters in southern Ontario, Canada, were examined for lead pellet ingestion by manual examination of gizzard contents and by radiography. Lead pellets were found to be ingested by chukars (6/76; 8%) and the common pheasant (16/47; 34%). Further, 13% (17/129) of the bird (wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo; Hungarian partridge, Perdix perdix; chukar; and common pheasant) livers analyzed had elevated lead concentrations (>= 6 mu g/g wet weight [ww]). Liver-lead concentrations above Health Canada's guideline for human consumption of fish protein (< 0.5 mu g/g ww) were found in 40% (51/129) of livers analyzed. Data indicate that the ingestion of lead pellets in upland game birds and the potential consumption of lead-contaminated meat by humans are concerns related to the continued use of lead shotshell for hunting.

AB  - In northern England, 95% of black grouse Tetra tetrix leks occur on the fringes of managed grouse moors. Recognising the threatened conservation status of black grouse in northern England, most grouse moors have refrained from deliberate shooting for more than a decade. Despite this, black grouse are unintentionally shot in mistake for red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We assessed the circumstances and frequency of shooting in northern England and its potential impact on population recovery from three independent sources, annual shooting returns as part of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust's (GWCT) National Gamebag Census (NGC), incidents of shooting reported independently to the North Pennines Black Grouse Recovery Project (NPBGRP) and losses of radio-tagged black grouse to shooting. Moors contributing to the NGC between 1998 and 2008 reported 110 black grouse shot from 13 of 23 moors, averaging 1.2% of the estimated post-breeding population. From 2001 to 2008, 152 black grouse from 28 moors were reported shot independently to the NPBGRP, equivalent to an annual 1.0% of the post-breeding population. The majority appeared unintentional (78%), with females (68%) more frequently shot. Out of 244 radio-tagged black grouse on 15 estates, four adult females were shot (1.6%). The voluntary restraint from harvesting black grouse in northern England appears effective, with incidents of shooting infrequent. Continued effort to minimise shooting incidents, particularly on the fringe of the range to encourage settlement of dispersing females, may contribute to increasing numbers and range.

AB  - 1. Capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan mortality resulting from collisions with high tension power lines (11-420 kV) was estimated, based on the number of casualties found per kilometre of power line patrolled in three boreal forest and low alpine areas.        2. The length (km) of high tension power lines crossing tetraonid habitats was estimated using Geographical Information Systems and general knowledge about species-specific habitats. Of the entire Norwegian high tension power-line grid system (about 95 000 km), 55% was estimated to cross capercaillie habitats, 56% black grouse habitats and 16% willow ptarmigan habitats.        3. Because of biasing factors related to data-collecting procedures, the number of collision victims found per kilometre of power line patrolled was increased by a factor varying from 6.0 to 14.9. The estimated losses were about 20 000, 26 000 and 50 000 for capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan, respectively, which are about 90%, 47% and 9% of the annual hunting harvest of these species.        4. It was concluded that this estimating procedure may be useful to wildlife management authorities to assess losses caused by overhead wires in general. Locally, this mortality factor should be carefully recorded and considered together with other mortality factors like hunting, to avoid overexploitation.

AB  - In the UK, hen harriers (Circus cyaneus) are illegally killed on moorland that is managed for red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus), and they produce fewer young per female on grouse moorland than on either unmanaged moorland or forestry. However, those breeding attempts on grouse moorland that escape nest destruction produce more young than in other land-use classes. One explanation for this difference is that food is more available to harriers on managed moorland than elsewhere. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the capture rates of hunting male harriers on sites across Scotland. Four of these sites were managed for grouse whilst the remaining three consisted of either unmanaged moorland or a mixture of unmanaged moorland and young forestry plantations. We found a significant difference in capture rates, with harriers on managed grouse moorland capturing prey at a greater rate than elsewhere, supporting the idea that prey were more available on grouse moorland. However, there was no difference in strike rates between the land-use classes, suggesting that prey were not necessarily more abundant on grouse moors. Males on unmanaged moorland tended to catch larger prey, though this was insufficient to compensate fully for the reduced capture rates. The improved hunting success on grouse moorland means that this habitat is likely to be more attractive to breeding harriers, thereby increasing the conflict between those interested in maximizing grouse numbers and those interested in conserving rare raptors.

AB  - Wildlife crime can be difficult to quantify, and its true impact on populations can be underestimated if rates are under-recorded. The illegal killing of birds of prey is an important form of wildlife crime, which in the UK, is often associated with land managed for the recreational shooting of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. In the UK, increases in peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus following recovery from organo-chlorine pesticides have not been uniform, with slow growth and localised declines in some areas, including those managed for red grouse shooting. In this study, we combined 1081 peregrine nest histories across northern England between 1980 and 2006 with a remotely sensed map of grouse moor management, to test whether breeding performance was lower in areas with active management for grouse shooting. Productivity of pairs on grouse moors was 50% lower than pairs breeding on non-grouse moor habitat. However, clutch size and brood size of successful nests did not differ between habitat types, suggesting that food constraints were unlikely to explain this difference. Population models suggested source-sink dynamics, with populations on grouse moors unable to sustain themselves without immigration. Population data confirmed that growth rates were indeed lower on grouse moors than on non-grouse moor sites. Analysis of wildlife crime data confirmed that persecution of the species was more frequent on grouse moors than in other habitat types. This population will be more secure, and better able to function as a barometer of environmental health and climate change, if illegal persecution of the species ceases on areas of land managed for grouse shooting.

AB  - The number of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) shot in the UK has declined by 50% during the 20th century. This decline has coincided with reductions in the area of suitable habitat and recoveries in the populations of some avian predators. Here we use long-term records of shooting bags and a large-scale manipulation of raptor density to disentangle the effects of habitat loss and raptor predation on grouse populations. The numbers of grouse harvested on the Eskdale half of Langholm Moor in southern Scotland declined significantly during 1913-1990 and grouse bags from the whole moor from 1950 to 1990 exhibited an almost identical but non-significant trend. Hen harriers (Circus cyaneus) and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were absent or bred at low densities on this moor throughout this period but heather-dominant vegetation declined by 48% between 1948 and 1988. Harrier and peregrine breeding numbers on Langholm Moor increased to high levels following protection in 1990 whilst grouse density and grouse bags declined year after year until shooting was abandoned in 1998. The prediction of a peak in grouse bags on Langholm Moor in 1996 based on the patterns of bags during 1950-1990 was supported by the observed peaks in 1997 on two nearby moors with few raptors which formerly cycled in synchrony with Langholm Moor. This study demonstrates that, whilst long-term declines in grouse bags were most probably due to habitat loss, high levels of raptor predation subsequently limited the grouse population and suppressed a cycle. This study thus offers support to theoretical models which predict that generalist predators may suppress cycles in prey populations.

AB  - Changes in the abundance of one prey species may indirectly affect other prey species by triggering responses in generalist predators. Here we examine relationships between two prey species that do not compete directly, the field vole Microtus agrestis, a common rodent with fluctuating populations, and the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica, a gamebird inhabiting open moorland, during a 27-year study on a moor in south-west Scotland. First, we test whether vole abundance was related to grouse density and demographic rates. Second, we test whether vole abundance was related to abundance indices of four common predators of both voles and grouse (red fox vulpes vulpes, weasel Mwtela nivalis, hen harrier Circus cyanew and common buzzard Buteo buteo). Third, we test whether these vole-grouse and vole-predator relationships differ in relation to grouse management, which includes the culling of foxes and weasels. We found no association between vole abundance and grouse densities, adult summer survival or nesting success. However, the ratio of young grouse per adult and the proportion of female grouse with broods in July were negatively associated with field vole abundance, suggesting increased predation of grouse chicks in years with high vole abundance. Fox indices showed a weak positive association with vole abundance when their numbers were not controlled, whilst weasel indices showed no relationship with voles. The numbers of breeding hen harriers and buzzards were also not associated with vole abundance, but the number of buzzard sightings was higher when voles were more plentiful. Our results are consistent with a negative interaction between field voles and red grouse chick survival in a pattern expected for apparent competition. Although the underlying mechanisms could not be disentangled, this interaction may be at least partly mediated by rodent-hunting raptors such as buzzards and, in periods without grouse management, foxes.

AB  - Studies of grouse conducted at northern latitudes have shown that tetraonids frequently exhibit cyclic fluctuations in abundance but little is known about the dynamics of grouse species at the southerly edge of their range. Hunting statistics from four species of grouse based on 30 yr of data collected from 210 hunting areas were examined from the Dolomitic Alps in the province of Trentino. These data were summed to represent 18 time series from discrete mountain groups. Analyses identified cycles of ca 5 yr in the minority of rock ptarmigan Lagopus mutus and hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia populations. These cycles only showed significant negative autocorrelation at half the cycle period and were classified as phase-forgetting quasi-cycles. Cycles were not found in time series of black grouse Tetrao tetrix or capercaillie Tetrao urogallus. Correcting Lime series for hunting effort or hunting restrictions tended to increase the proportion of populations that exhibited cycles bur no difference in the strength of second order density dependence. A linear first order density-dependent autoregressive model described the dynamics of most of the populations with the exception of a proportion of rock ptarmigan and black grouse populations where a non linear first order model provided the best fit. We compare the findings with studies conducted in Finland and suggest possible reasons for the reduced tendency to cycle in the populations of southern Europe.

AB  - More than 4 million farm-reared red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa; hereafter partridge) are released each year in autumn for harvest purposes in Spain. We compared the helminth fauna of 122 juvenile, farm-reared partridge from 9 farms around Spain with that of 174 wild partridge from 7 harvest areas where no releases currently are conducted. We examined the digestive tract, liver, and trachea. Fourteen helminth species were retrieved (6 from farm-reared partridge, 9 from wild partridge). No trematode or nematode species were shared by both groups of partridge, and only I cestode species was present in both populations. Monoxenous nematodes were the most prevalent species found in farm-reared birds. Ascaridia compar, a parasite of the rock partridge (A. graeca) previously unreported in the red-legged partridge, was found in 4 facilities. Heteroxenous helminths, such as Dicrocoelium sp., Raillietina tetragona, and Cheilospirura gruveli, predominated in wild partridge. The prevalence and intensity of helminths in some farmed partridge were higher than expected considering the routine use of antihelminthics in these facilities. Thus, released partridge may introduce new parasites into wild populations, come into contact with parasites of wild partridge, and be negatively affected by their parasite burdens after release. These risks require further study.

AB  - Mountain hares Lepus timidus, incorporating the subspecies L. t. varronis, L. t. bibernicus and L. t. scoticus, have declined in range throughout continental Europe where they face pressures from climate-change, competition and land-management. In Scotland, the absence of a national monitoring scheme, including mandatory reporting of hunting records, means that producing robust estimates of mountain hare population trends is difficult. We repeated questionnaire surveys conducted in 1995/1996 and 2006/2007 to assess the 2016/2017 distribution and hunting records of mountain hares in Scotland and describe regional changes in their distribution over a 20-year period in relation to management for red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica shooting. Comparisons of areas covered in all surveys indicated no net change in the area of Scotland occupied by mountain hares, but within that we found changes in range between regions and sites of differing grouse management intensity. Between 1995/1996 and 2016/2017, range contractions in southern Scotland contrasted with no changes in north-east Scotland. In north-west Scotland range expanded by 61% in areas practicing driven grouse shooting, declined by 57% in areas practicing walked-up grouse shooting and remained low and stable in areas which did not shoot grouse. A total of 33 582 mountain hares were killed in 2016/2017 representing a 71% and 48% increase from 1995/1996 and 2006/2007 respectively. However, the average kill density in 2016/2017 (12.4 3.3 hares km(-2)) was comparable to 2006/2007 (10.8 +/- 3.0 km(-2)) and we found no relationship between kill density and contractions in range. Despite increases in numbers of mountain hares killed over the last 20 years, it appears that range contraction may be attributed to factors other than culling, such as changes in habitat and management. Disentangling these factors should be the focus of future research.

AB  - Hunted game birds (eight partridges, nine wood pigeons, 25 quails, 16 chilled and 16 frozen-thawed pheasants) were processed according to "Good Manufacturing Practice" rules. Microflora of skin, intestinal content and meat cuts (breast and thigh, both fresh and stored in vacuum package) was analysed. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were not recovered from any sample. Log microbial numbers on skin or in intestines were not significantly related to those on meat cuts. With the exception of pigeons, microbial numbers of the two meat cuts did not differ significantly (p > 0.05), and no significant increase in microbial numbers in vacuum-stored meat was found; the same applied to frozen-thawed compared to chilled pheasants. On meat, average total viable counts were < 4.00 log cfu/cm(2) with a maximum of 6.48 log cfu/cm(2). Median Escherichia coli numbers were < 2.00 log cfu/cm(2), maximum was 4.48 log cfu/cm(2). Meat cuts obtained from partridges, quails and pheasants demonstrated a shelf life of 1 week, provided they were kept vacuum-packaged at 0A degrees C to 1A degrees C.

AB  - Local and regional extirpations of individual species, typically high profile cases, are now well documented, leading to calls for urgent action for particular species in specific locations. There is a need to broaden our assessments of extinction to identify landscapes that contain high proportions of threatened species and therefore, how more holistic species conservation responses might be developed. The conservation status of species is especially concerning in Southeast Asia and within the region, the avian family Phasianidae affords the opportunity to develop an approach for examining species richness and extinction probability for an entire family at landscape scale. There are 42 pheasant, partridge and quail species in the region and 77% of Southeast Asia encompasses the geographic range of at least five species. Due to high levels of uncertainty about how species respond to anthropogenic threats, we created an expert elicited Bayesian Belief Network to explore survival prospects using publically available data on IUCN extinction probability categories, proxies of threat (effects of hunting, forest loss and protected area effectiveness) and species geographic ranges to assess where the overall risk to survival was highest.        Western Myanmar, Central Indoburma (Thailand/Myanmar), the Annamite mountains and Central Vietnam lowlands, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo are priorities for avoiding large numbers of extinctions of phasianids. This assessment will be strengthened by more detailed data on intensity of hunting pressure across the region, and variation in species' tolerance to human disturbance. Strategically, therefore, conservation and research should be targeted towards these landscapes.

AB  - 1. Recreational hunting is widespread and can benefit nature conservation when well-practised, monitored, and regulated. Management for recreational red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica shooting on upland heathland in the UK causes conservation conflict because the intensive habitat, predator, and disease management needed to maintain high-grouse densities for "driven" shooting has detrimental environmental impacts, notably for raptor populations.        2. Sustainable management of mountain hares Lepus timidus scoticus, a game species in the same landscapes, poses a challenge. Control of transmission to grouse of a viral disease, louping-ill, for which mountain hares are a host, has become an additional motivation to kill mountain hares since research during 1993-2001 suggested that culls might reduce infection rates in grouse.        3. We analysed population trends of mountain hares from spring counts on moorland managed for grouse shooting and on contiguous alpine land. On moorland sites, a long-term decline (4.6% per annum) from 1954 to 1999 increased to 30.7% per annum from then until 2017, with a density index falling to <1% of initial levels after 2008. Before 1999, declines were associated with conifer planting and were least severe where heather burning characteristic of grouse management was present. Grouse moors had the highest rate of decline after 1999.        4. On alpine sites, the density index increased by 2.0% per annum from 1954 to 2007, then declined by 12.3% per annum but remained within the previous range of variation.        5. Despite lack of evidence that it increases grouse numbers, reduction of louping-ill transmission to grouse became a more frequent justification for mountain hare culls at a time consistent with it causing these recent, rapid mountain hare declines on grouse moors.        6. Synthesis and applications. Long-term field counts suggest that intensification of game bird management has resulted in severe, recent declines in mountain hare numbers, exacerbating longer term declines associated with land-use change. Management practices founded on misinterpretation of earlier research are the probable cause. Regulation of hare culling would provide a framework for formal tests of whether culls affect grouse surpluses. It would also provide an opportunity to examine mountain hare populations' resilience to culls of varying size and seasonal timing.

AB  - Genetic introgression with exotic genomes represents a major conservation concern for the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae). In particular, massive releases of chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) and/or red-legged x chukar partridge hybrids for hunting purposes have cast serious doubts on the Italian present-day occurrence of wild A. rufa populations not affected by introgressive hybridization. This study investigates the genetic structure of red-legged partridges populations in two ecologically different areas in Northern Italy. Analysis of maternal mitochondrial DNA and biparental microsatellite markers excluded the presence of hybridization in a typical agricultural habitat where hunting and release of reared birds are strictly banned. By contrast, signs of chukar introgression were detected in a perifluvial habitat unusual for the red-legged partridge in Italy. The present study documents the first red-legged partridge population with no genetic evidences of recent chukar introgression presently living in Italy. We recommend that urgent conservation actions are taken to preserve the genetic integrity of this population from the risk of hybridization with farm-reared birds and to support its long-term conservation.

AB  - The Appalachian Cooperative Grouse Research Project (ACGRP) was a multistate cooperative effort initiated in 1996 to investigate the apparent decline of ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) and improve management throughout the central and southern Appalachian region (i.e., parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina, USA). Researchers have offered several hypotheses to explain the low abundance of ruffed grouse in the region, including low availability of early-successional forests due to changes in land use, additive harvest mortality, low productivity and recruitment, and nutritional stress. As part of the ACGRP, we investigated ruffed grouse population ecology. Our objectives were to estimate reproductive rates, estimate survival and cause-specific mortality rates, examine if ruffed grouse harvest in the Appalachian region is compensatory, and estimate ruffed grouse finite population growth. We trapped > 3,000 ruffed grouse in autumn (Sep-Nov) and spring (Feb-Mar) from 1996 to September 2002 on 12 study areas. We determined the age and gender of each bird and fitted them with necklace-style radiotransmitters and released them at the trap site. We tracked ruffed grouse >= 2 times per week using handheld radiotelemetry equipment and gathered data on reproduction, recruitment, survival, and mortality. Ruffed grouse population dynamics in the Appalachian region differed from the central portion of the species' range (i.e., northern United States and Canada). Ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region had lower productivity and recruitment, but higher survival than reported for populations in the Great Lakes region and southern Canada. Population dynamics differed between oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) and mixed-mesophytic forest associations within the southern and central Appalachian region. Productivity and recruitment were lower in oak-hickory forests, but adult survival was higher than in mixed-mesophytic forests. Furthermore, ruffed grouse productivity and recruitment were more strongly related to hard mast (i.e., acorn) production in oak-hickory forests than in mixed-mesophytic forests. The leading cause of ruffed grouse mortality was avian predation (44% of known mortalities). Harvest mortality accounted for 12% ofall known mortalities and appeared to be compensatory. Population models indicated ruffed grouse populations in the Appalachian region are declining (lambda = 0.7-0.95), but differences in model estimates highlighted the need for improved understanding of annual productivity and recruitment. We posit ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region exhibit a clinal population structure characterized by changes in life-history strategies. Changes in life history strategies are in response to gradual changes in forest structure, quality of food resources, snowfall and accumulation patterns, and predator communities. Management efforts should focus on creating a mosaic of forest stand ages across the landscape to intersperse habitat resources including nesting and brood cover, adult escape cover, roosting sites, and, most importantly, food resources. Land managers can intersperse habitat resources through a combination of clearcutting, shelterwood harvests, group selection, and timber stand improvement (including various thinnings and prescribed fire). Managers should maintain current ruffed grouse harvest rates while providing high quality hunting opportunities. We define high quality hunting as low hunting pressure, low vehicle traffic, and high flush rates.        Managers ca provide high quality hunting opportunities through use of road closures in conjunction with habitat management.

AB  - The rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) is a popular game bird in Iceland, but the population has endured a long-term decline. A hunting ban was enforced in 2003, but 2 years later hunting was allowed again with added restrictions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a change in hunting regulations on the ptarmigan population in northeast Iceland, 1998-2013, using a population reconstruction model and to estimate the abundance of juveniles and adults, natural survival, and harvest mortality. The estimated abundance at the beginning of the hunting season ranged from 42,000 (95% CI=36,000-49,000) birds in 2002 to 158,000 (95% CI=105,000-250,000) in 1998. The natural survival of adult rock ptarmigan was density dependent and ranged from 36% to 65% (95% CI=30-75%). Survival for juveniles was constant and was estimated to be 19% (95% CI=18-20%). We included a change point in the model to account for a change in the harvest mortality that could have occurred with the changes in the hunting regulations. The results indicated that the change in hunting regulations did reduce ptarmigan harvest mortality and changed the harvest strategies of hunters. Inclusion of a change point in models is useful for managers to test if a change in regulations had an effect on the target population. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Large numbers of gamebirds (pheasants Phasianus colchicus, red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa and mallard Anus platyrhynchos) are released annually in the UK to support recreational shooting. It is important to know how many of these birds are being released because their release and management has ecological effects on the wildlife and habitats of the UK. There is little regulation governing their release, and consequently, an accurate figure for the numbers being released is unknown. I took 12 different approaches, totalling 4329 estimates of the numbers of birds being released annually, based on a series of datasets that described numbers of birds being held for breeding, rearing or release, being released, managed or shot on game shoots, being shot by individual guns or being recorded during breeding bird surveys. These 12 approaches produced estimates ranging from 14.7 to 106.1 million with a mean of 43.2 million (95% CI 29.0-57.3 million). This suggests that 31.5 million pheasants (range 29.8-33.7 million), 9.1 million red-legged partridges (range 5.6-12.5 million) and 2.6 million mallard (range 0.9-6.0 million) are released annually in the UK. These figures differ substantially from both official records of gamebirds and previous published estimates, and I discuss why such differences may occur. I set these figures in the context of the number and behaviour of shoots operating in the UK. Improved estimates of numbers of gamebird being released are critical if we are to better understand the ecological effects occurring in areas where they are released and managed.

AB  - The ratio of juveniles to adults in the fall harvest is a common index of production for Galliformes. The percentage of juvenile birds in the harvest has been shown to decline as the hunting season progressed for many galliforms, resulting in a biased index of production. Therefore, we used wing samples of plains sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus jamesi) and greater prairie-chickens (T. cupido pinnatus) from 4 public land areas in the Nebraska Sandhills, Nebraska, USA, to assess the potential for bias in harvest-age ratios across tune. We hypothesized that the ratio of juveniles to adults in the harvest could change over time if susceptibility to harvest and/or fall survival were different between the juvenile and adult prairie grouse (Tympanuchus spp.) in the Nebraska populations. We found no change in the harvest-age ratio over time in either the sharp-tailed grouse or greater prairie-chicken data. Our findings were consistent with the published literature on harvest-age rates for sharp-tailed grouse but inconsistent with the greater prairie-chicken literature. Therefore, we maintain that analysis of the harvest data for bias due to a changing harvest-age ratio as the hunting season progresses is an essential adjunct to subsequent analysis or comparisons of production indices based on harvest-age ratios. In addition, limitations of harvest-age ratios must be known and care must be taken to minimize other potential biases before using harvestage ratios as an index to production.

AB  - Around 60% of pheasants released for shooting in the UK, an estimated 21 million birds, do not end up at their intended fate: being shot. This constitutes wastage, raising economic, environmental and ethical questions. We review what is known of the fates of released pheasants and consider why they do not directly contribute to the numbers harvested. We focus on four main explanations: predation, disease, starvation and dispersal, and highlight other important causes of mortality. For each explanation, we attempt to attribute levels of loss and identify timings or conditions when such losses may be heaviest. We review factors that exacerbate losses and methods available to mitigate them. Opportunities for amelioration may arise at all stages of the rearing and release of pheasants and involve changes to the conditions under which eggs are produced, the way young pheasants are reared or the management of the environment into which they are released. We found few studies investigating impacts of post-release management techniques on pheasant survival outside of the breeding season within a UK context. We found that a number of less commonly deployed practices focusing on early-life, pre-release management may improve survival. Given the scale of pheasant releasing in the UK, even improvements in survival of 1% would mean that similar to 350,000 fewer birds die of natural causes. Complementing current post-release management with proven novel pre-release management interventions could reduce the number of pheasants required for release, whilst maintaining current shooting levels. Lowering release numbers would lower financial costs, benefit the environment and reduce some ethical concerns over the release and shooting of reared pheasants.

AB  - Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam form a diverse and important region for the order Galliformes with at least 21 species, comprising 10 pheasants, seven partridges, three quails and one francolin. Several are endemic to the region and several are considered globally threatened. Information was collated for each species on the Indochinese range, habitat use and conservation status. This information was used to determine gross patterns in conservation requirements, prioritised partly through the global importance of the Indochinese population. The galliform species at most immediate risk in Indochina is probably Green Peafowl, through heavy hunting exacerbated by increasing human access to former wildernesses. The endemic Edwards's Pheasant also merits specific conservation attention. Other forest species occur widely throughout surviving habitat, which remains landscape-scale despite serious losses in recent decades. Non-forest species, notably three quails (none endemic) remain very poorly known and threat levels cannot be assessed. For galliform conservation in Indochina by far the most important action is turning the existing declared protected areas networks into functional reality conserving a multitude of landscapes, each of hundreds of square kilometres, across the region. Past assessments of threat level to Indochinese forest Galliformes have been alarmist: many species are persisting in heavily-hunted fragments of the 10-50 sq. km size class, where many other forest vertebrates have been extirpated.

AB  - In some parts of Britain, pheasants Phasianus colchicus are infested by Ixodes ricinus ticks in the spring and summer. The effects of experimental reduction of tick infestation levels on the breeding success and survival of reared female pheasants were studied on two estates in southern England during 1995-1997. Females were radio-tagged and half of the birds, selected at random, were fitted with a slow-release acaricide, which substantially reduced their tick burdens. Clutch survival was significantly higher for treated females throughout the three-year study period, and hence more chicks were hatched by treated females (3.30 +/- 0.86) than by control females (0.70 +/- 0.36), even though treated and control birds produced the same numbers of clutches and eggs. During April-July, the female survival rate was significantly higher for acaricide-treated birds, showing an improvement of 10-15% over that of control birds each year. While these impacts will be of minor importance where annual pheasant releasing takes place to supplement autumn stocks for shooting, they might reduce the potential harvest on estates with wild pheasants or on those aiming to re-establish self-sustaining naturalised populations.

AB  - Aim Mountains host complex ecosystems whose wide range of ecological conditions over small geographical distances makes them biodiversity hotspots. To ensure their long-term conservation, a better understanding of the interaction between climate change and modifications in land use is necessary. Most studies have focused on only one of these factors at a time, leading to incomplete predictions. In this study, we explored the relative contribution of both recreative activities and climate change on the population dynamics of the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), an emblematic cold-adapted species of the Alps.        Methods We used data from a network of 47 monitoring sites dispersed around the French Alps and surveyed since the 1980s or 1990s. We estimated black grouse population growth rates using state-space models and tested for effects of biotic and abiotic pressures on both long-term trends and inter-annual variations in these rates.        Results Population trajectories were strongly heterogeneous in space; nevertheless, a general decline at the edge of the black grouse distribution area was revealed in the southern pre-Alps. We found very little influence of hunting and new ski lift cables installation on inter-annual variability in population growth rate. In contrast, our results suggest strong impact of climatic conditions and phenology. While temperature positively influenced growth rate, precipitation had a negative effect. Early snowmelt and vegetation season were correlated with high positive values of annual population growth rates.        Main conclusions Birds in mountain habitats may be drastically affected by ongoing climate change, perhaps to a greater extent than by an increase in recreational activities. However, other human activities in the mountains (such as animal grazing or forest exploitation) that were not taken into consideration in this study might also have a strong impact on habitat structure and indirectly affect populations' growth.

AB  - Grey partridge populations declined in Europe from mid-1950s onwards mostly due to modifications of agricultural cropping. In Italy, the decline was even more dramatic because of over-hunting and restocking with allochthonous birds. We carried out a research on a re-introduced population in Central Italy from 1995 to 2005, with the aim of evaluating the reintroduction success and separating the intrinsic and external factors influencing year-to-year changes in partridge density with particular respect to the weather. Average spring density was 4.5 pairs per square kilometre (SD = 1.52); our population reached a peak few years after the reintroduction and then declined. Brood production rate was close to that of declining European populations (average 33.9%; SD = 10.21), and chick survival rate (average 40%; SD = 17.61) determined the change of breeding abundance from year t to year t + 1. Our population seemed to be mainly affected by brood production and chick survival rates and by the weather; in particular, higher early winter and spring temperatures increased breeding density whilst higher early summer temperatures decreased brood production rate.

AB  - 1. Harvesting records of rock partridge (Alectoris graeca saxatilis) were examined first to identify the presence of cycles in a species with a southern European distribution and then to examine synchrony between populations at a range of scales.        2, Hunting records from 1965 to 1994 were obtained from 210 hunting areas and analysed at three spatial scales: subpopulation, population and metapopulation. Rock partridge exhibited cyclic fluctuations in about 40% of the time series with a period of 4-7 years. The results did not change with spatial scale. The density-dependent structure of the populations showed that most populations exhibited damped oscillations.        3. The proportion of populations that were in synchrony increased with scale from the population to metapopulation level. There was no decline in synchrony with distance but a large variation between populations irrespective of distance.        4. The populations clustered into dry and wet habitats, with those in the dry habitat being more cyclic. We suggest the lack of spatial synchrony with distance but greater synchrony within habitats may reflect the influence of stochastic events operating on populations with different density dependence structures.

AB  - Hunting bag data for Namaqua sandgrouse Pterocles namaqua from an estate near Kimberley, South Africa, for the period 1907-1992 were analysed to investigate population trends, environmental correlates and to develop predictive models for population fluctuations An apparent population decline between 1950 and 1992 may be an artifact of increased sandgrouse dispersion in response to an increased number of artificial watering points on the estate, and in the surrounding area, during this latter period. Peaks in sandgrouse abundance are significantly negatively correlated with December rainfall and significantly positively correlated with March rainfall. Furthermore, annual sandgrouse abundance and March rainfall showed similar peaks at four-year cycles during 1909-1939. Therefore, a rainfall 'score' which takes cognizance of both December and March rainfall is useful for predicting annual sandgrouse abundance before the forthcoming hunting season. However, correct predictions of low sandgrouse abundance were more common than correct predictions of high sandgrouse abundance. These environmental correlates and predictive models are useful for forecasting the annual viability of commercial hunting of these populations.

AB  - A Norwegian program for extermination of (small game) predators (NPEP) was run during 1900-1914. This initiative is believed to have caused larger small game stocks and more regional synchrony in rodents. To investigate the effectiveness of the NPEP time series of predators bountied (1885-1914), rodent dynamics (1885-1914), ptarmigan hunting index (1885-1914 and 1900/1-1914), and willow ptarmigan and berry export statistics (1885-1914) were analyzed for three different regions: south, east and central Norway. In south and east Norway there were higher ptarmigan export in the period 1907-1914 than the years before, but not in central Norway. There was not bountied higher number of red fox, eagle or goshawk in any of the three regions when comparing years a) before and after 1900, and b) when comparing the periods 1900-1906 and 1907-1914. This suggests that predator removal was not the cause of increased ptarmigan export. The ptarmigan hunting index and rodent index for south and cast Norway were correlated in the period 1885-1914, while the ptarmigan export from east Norway was correlated with berry export from the year before. However, for central Norway the rodent index was not correlated with the hunting index. There were cross correlation between berry and ptarmigan export with lag from minus one to nine years for south and east Norway. The NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) - an indication of the winter weather variation - had higher values during 1900-1914 than 1885-1899, indicating moister and warmer winters in the last period. This analysis indicates that NPEP generally did not increase predator removal. The results suggest, however, that it was a series of years with high rodent density, that caused the increase in ptarmigan populations in south and east Norway, which, in turn, may have been caused by favourable weather conditions leading to among others good berry crops. Conclusions based on old data series must, however, be drawn with caution.

AB  - The release of artificially reared pheasants is a widespread practice in Great Britain, used to increase the number of birds available for hunting. We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of release and shooting between 1960 and 2014 using data from a self-selected sample of 1195 sites. We examined changes in the efficiency of release, the contribution of birds that were not released that year to the numbers shot, and the form of these relationships through time. An annual estimate of the efficiency by which releasing increased the numbers shot was 50% over the period 1960-1990 declining rapidly to 35% by 2005 and reducing more slowly thereafter. There was no obvious regional pattern to this relationship. It has been hypothesised that the efficiency of releasing is lower on sites that release higher densities of pheasants; this study does not support this hypothesis. Annual variation in the density of birds shot in the absence of releasing (1960-1990) was closely correlated with a measure of annual gamebird chick survival. After this date, the relationship was no longer significant, consistent with a decline in wild pheasant stocks and coinciding with the declines in other farmland birds. We highlight increased fox abundance, genetic and behavioural changes arising from the rearing process, and increased shooting in late winter as possible causes for the observed decline in releasing efficiency. We consider the general increase in rearing, habitat changes, increased disease or losses to protected predators as unlikely to have been important causes of the changes in releasing efficiency. Pheasant releasing results in increased numbers for shooting, but has not prevented the wide-scale decline of wild pheasant numbers.

AB  - Marking birds is a vital tool for determining survival, habitat-use patterns, and movements. For galliform species, metal leg bands and radio-transmitters are widely used marking techniques. While commonly used on adult birds, leg banding and radio-marking of galliform chicks are not commonly employed. During a two-year study to evaluate survival, dispersal, and habitat-use of released four-week old ring-necked pheasants Phasianus colchicus, we sought to mark chicks in a manner that allowed us to track them post-release and recognize them if harvested as adults. Our objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of four banding techniques: 1) standard bands for adult ring-necked pheasants [no. 6 aluminum butt-end bands], 2) colored plastic spiral leg bands commonly used for banding poultry, 3) no. 6 bands and plastic spiral leg bands to prevent the aluminum bands from slipping off, and 4) cotton-filled no. 6 bands to prevent bands from slipping off and allow growth of the tarsus. We also evaluated two radio-transmitter attachment methods: gluing or suturing transmitters on the back of four-week-old chicks. The no. 6 bands did not stay attached to the birds due to the bands being too large, and plastic spiral bands commonly caused constriction of the legs, possibly crippling birds. However, using cotton filled leg-bands was a reliable method for marking pheasant chicks. Although gluing has been used successfully as a radio-transmitter attachment method in other studies, in our study it largely failed given that few radio-transmitters remained attached beyond two days. Suturing was an effective method (90% of the transmitters remained attached until death or expected life of the battery) for attaching radio-transmitters to ring-necked pheasant chicks. Our field study has revealed promising approaches and we suggest that a captive study should now evaluate the possible sub-lethal effects (e.g. growth rates, body condition, transmitter retention times) of these attachment methods.

AB  - Populations of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been declining throughout their range since the 1960s. Productivity, which includes production and survival of young, is often cited as a factor in these declines. We monitored radio-equipped Greater Sage-Grouse at 3 sites in western Wyoming to assess early brood-rearing habitat use (through 14 days post-hatch) and productivity. Logistic and linear regression analyses with Akaike's Information Criterion were used to evaluate early brooding habitat use and to examine relationships between productivity and vegetation, insect size and abundance, and weather parameters. Females with broods were found in areas with greater sagebrush canopy and grass cover, and fewer invertebrates compared to random areas. The number of juveniles per female (estimated from wing barrel collections during fall harvest) was positively related to the abundance of medium-length Hymenoptera and grass cover, and the proportion of females with confirmed chicks 14 days post-hatch was positively related to abundance of medium-length Coleoptera and total herbaceous cover. Although the specific parameters varied slightly, Greater Sage-Grouse productivity in Wyoming appeared to be associated with a combination of insect and herbaceous cover elements. Managing for abundant and diverse insect communities within dense protective sagebrush stands should help ensure high-quality early brood-rearing habitat and increased Greater Sage-Grouse productivity.

AB  - The long-term temporal dynamics of four grouse species in the Italian Alps have been investigated in the attempt to reveal if the populations exhibit the tendency to cycle at the southern edge of their European range. Hunting statistics or count data were collected as total number of individuals shot or counted each year from five provinces. For the province of Trento data were available at the level of mountain groups and a more detailed investigation was carried out. The results from Trento were compared with the more general findings from the other four Italian provinces. Time series analysis was performed to investigate the pattern of cycle and autoregressive models were used to describe the density dependence structure. In general, the populations showed a weak or no tendency to regular fluctuations: rock ptarmigan Lagopus mutus and black grouse Tetrao tetrix populations exhibited the highest tendency to cycle with periods of 5-9 years while capercaillie Tetrao urogallus never showed regular fluctuations. Hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia cyclic dynamics were restricted to a few populations of Trento. When time series from Trento were corrected for hunting effort the detection of cycle among populations sharply increased but no differences in the strength of second order density dependence or in the period length was observed. A linear first order autoregressive model explained better the intrinsic structure of the majority of populations. We compare the findings with studies conducted on populations of northern Europe and suggest possible reasons for the reduced tendency to cycle in the grouse populations of the Italian Alps.

AB  - The recovery of protected predators raises tensions and divisions within society when their prey are of socio-economic value. For instance, conflicts may arise when hunters perceive protected predators as a threat for declining game populations, and cull them. These conflicts can have a strong impact on the status of the affected predator species. In this paper we review a conflict between hunters and raptor protectionists related to grey partridge Perdix perdix - hen harrier Circus cyaneus relationships in central northern France. We compiled all available information from scientific journals as well as hunting or protectionist journals, in order to present the polarised views of the problem and to analyse the social, political, legal and scientific aspects of the conflict. The results of existing studies suggest that in some circumstances hen harrier predation may have an impact on grey partridge populations. However, these studies also suggest that the problem is currently restricted to certain areas. The impact of hen harrier predation on grey partridge populations is not fully understood. Further research is therefore needed to better understand the ecological basis of the conflict. We also present and discuss potential solutions to alleviate predation that might help to reduce the conflict.

AB  - Although numerous studies have focused on estimating economic benefits associated with big game hunting experiences, economic valuation efforts examining small game hunting have largely been neglected. This is especially surprising with respect to hunting grouse, a family of widely distributed upland game birds targeted by about 800,000 hunters in 2011. Furthermore, despite efforts by federal and state agencies directed at improving and increasing public land for recreational hunting purposes, a dearth of studies exist regarding the economic benefits of public land to hunters. Using the travel cost method and data from a 2008 survey of Michigan ruffed grouse hunters, we examine relationships between hunting site choice and publicly accessible hunting land. We find that federally owned land, state-owned land, and publicly accessible, privately owned Commercial Forest Act (CFA) land are positive predictors of hunter site selection (P<0.001). Given this relationship, we then estimated the economic benefits of different types of publicly accessible land to ruffed grouse hunters by examining the willingness of hunters to incur increasing travel costs to hunt in counties with greater amounts of publicly accessible land. We estimated the economic benefits of publicly accessible hunting land for ruffed grouse hunters in Michigan to be over $20 million in 2008, with economic benefits of CFA land comprising about $6.9 million of this annual total. Estimating the economic benefits of publicly accessible hunting land for outdoor recreationists provides a useful metric for policy makers to use in evaluating how changes in the amount and nature of publicly accessible hunting land affects these individuals.

AB  - The grey partridge Perdix perdix is an important gamebird in Europe. Its numbers have decreased dramatically during the XXth century and releases are commonly undertaken for the conservation of the populations and/or hunting purposes in Western Europe. However, this practice that generally involves birds from commercial farms raises several concerns, among which a potential hybridization between farmed and wild individuals. Herein, based on microsatellite markers, we characterize the genetic patterns of farmed birds in view of wild birds of the two French subspecies (P. p. armoricana in central-northern France and P. p. hispaniensis in the Pyrenees). Hence, we estimate the risk of genetic introgression between wild and farmed birds. Our results highlight a genetic divergence between both subspecies-in accordance with the known evolutionary history of the grey partridge during the Quaternary. In central-northern France, a slight but significant difference in the genetic signature between wild and farmed partridges is detected. This difference however does not seem prone to alter the gene pool of wild birds if farmed birds are released in the wild and reproduce. On the contrary, in the Pyrenees, the large and significant genetic difference between wild and farmed birds represents a real risk of genetic introgression. This threat should be taken into account in population management.

AB  - Dispersal may affect survival and recruitment of yearlings into the breeding population and, thus, be a factor regulating population density. Therefore, we documented natal dispersal and recruitment of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) from 2 populations in northcentral Colorado between 1966 and 1990. Recoveries and returns of 1,437 birds banded as juveniles totaled 326 (22.7%); 258 (79.1%) were males and 68 (20.9%) were females. We calculated natal dispersal distances of 126 males and 40 females banded prior to brood breakup (15 Sep) and relocated during subsequent breeding seasons. Males had high philopatry to natal areas (median dispersal distance = 1.25 km); whereas females dispersed farther (median dispersal distance = 4.00 km). More than half (51.1%) of yearling males, but only 12.9% of yearling females, recruited into the breeding population at the Rocky Mountain National Park study area, had originally been banded as juveniles. The higher return rate of banded juvenile males was due to their high natal philopatry because there was no difference in total numbers of yearling males and females recruited. The minimum September-June survival rate of banded juvenile males was 35.0% in an unhunted population and 34.3% in a hunted population. Short natal dispersal distances of male white-tailed ptarmigan affected colonization of vacant habitats and should be considered in transplant programs.

AB  - Introduction of wildlife for game restocking is one major pathway of genetic homogenization. The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae), a small game bird native to south-western Europe, is in high demand by hunters and natural populations are constantly supplemented by commercial stocks of captive-bred individuals. Also, in recent years human-mediated hybridization with congeneric chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar: Greece, Cyprus, from Middle East to East Asia) has been frequently documented in the wild and in captivity. This study attempts to evaluate the genetic consequences of intensive captive breeding and restocking in the A. rufa species. We investigated A. rufa genetic diversity by making comparisons in both a spatial (across the entire species' range) and a temporal framework. We accomplished this latter by comparing modern vs. ancient partridges resident in museums and collected 1856-1934, well before supplemental stocking became common. Using mtDNA we found significant changes in the haplotype profile of modern vs. ancient A. rufa, and widespread introgression with chukar genes across the entire species range only in modern representatives, with the relevant exception of Corsican populations. However, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), as opposed to microsatellite DNA markers, showed also modern Corsican populations to harbour many A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids. We conclude that captive breeding programs should make strict use of time-saving and comparatively low cost DNA barcodes to minimize genetic pollution, such as those provided by diagnostic RAPD markers. We also recommend that the active ban on import of exotics and/or hybrids be extended to non-local populations. Altogether this would represent a substantial step forward to preserve A. rufa as well as other game species subjected to similar intensive management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neonicotinoids have been detected in many species of wild birds; however, few studies have quantified population-level exposure. We examined population-level exposure to 7 neonicotinoids in 2 species that use agricultural areas, sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) and greater prairie-chickens (T. cupido). We sampled fecal pellets at leks in spring and collected livers from hunter-harvested birds in fall along an agricultural gradient throughout their respective ranges in Minnesota, USA. Most sharp-tailed grouse (93 %) and prairie-chicken (80 %) fecal pellets and livers (90 % and 76 %, respectively) had detectable concentrations of >= 1 neonicotinoid, with imidacloprid (IMI) and clothianidin (CLO) most commonly detected. Spring detections of IMI in both species increased with the propor-tion of a 2-km buffer in cultivation surrounding sampling locations and varied by year. A similar relationship with cul-tivation was not supported for CLO, which may reflect differences in the availability of seed types treated with IMI and CLO on the soil surface after planting. However, we also detected IMI and CLO from birds sampled in areas of low cul-tivation. Sharp-tailed grouse and prairie-chickens may select crop fields preferentially to forage, and thus have a higher risk of exposure than would be expected based only on the amount of cultivation. Year was important in models of IMI and CLO in both species and seasons, which likely reflects differences in planting and in the availability of natural foods among years. In contrast, the proportion of surrounding area in cultivation was not supported in models of fall neonicotinoid detections. Fewer crops are planted in the fall in Minnesota and grouse may be exposed through routes other than treated seeds. High detections, even in areas with little cultivation and during seasons with little planting, likely reflect prairie grouse selection of cultivated fields for food, but may also indicate that exposure risk ex-tends beyond sites of application.

AB  - In black grouse Tetrao tetrix the survival of juveniles from hatching until recruitment is a critical determinant of population growth. The proportion of juvenile survivors from hatching until recruitment declines continually, but juvenile mortality rates are commonly highest during approximately the first 10 days after hatching. Likely causes of mortality include adverse weather, predation and availability of food. Little is known, however, about how individual properties, such as body mass of hen or chicks and properties of the brood rearing environment (e.g. vegetation characteristics or weather conditions) interact with each other and/or with fluctuating levels of predator abundance in determining early brood survival, simply because such data are very scarce. Using an information-theoretic approach, our paper identifies determinants of early daily survival rates of black grouse chicks in a managed forest landscape of central Finland. During the three years of our study, the proportion of hens losing their broods within 10 days after hatching varied between 0.08 and 0.36.The variation in daily survival rates of chicks was largely mediated by a combination of four key explanatory variables. Brood survival clearly increased with the extent of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus cover, and was further affected by interactions of temperature and hatching date as well as temperature and chick body mass. Low temperatures consistently resulted in lower daily survival rates. An increase in temperature, however, was more beneficial for early hatchers and heavy chicks. There was no difference in survival between broods from yearling and adult hens and we found no effect of predator density, be it as main effect or as interaction with other variables, on the daily survival rates of chicks. Improving black grouse breeding success can be regarded as a key management target which may be critical for their recovery. Our results suggest that such management should favour protection or local recovery of bilberry, as well as integrate weather and climate changes into the equation of hunting management.

AB  - The release of farm-reared game birds for hunting is an increasingly common game management practice. However, releasing could have negative effects on sympatric wild species, for example, through parasite transmission. Here, we document the spatial-temporal patterns and intensity of red-legged partridge releases in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain, over a 15-year period (2002-2016), relating them to local changes in the abundance of little bustards estimated from two surveys carried out in 2005 and 2016. Within the province, > 600,000 red-legged partridges were released annually over at least 20% of the area. Releasing intensity varied between estates and fluctuated over the 15-year study period, probably because of an economic crisis during 2008-2014. Overall, numbers of little bustards dropped by 46% between surveys, the decrease being more marked in the west of the province. Contrary to expectation, the only hunting estates where little bustards did not decrease were those with higher release intensity. This may be a consequence of management measures or other factors that benefit little bustards and are more prevalent on those estates than elsewhere, such as game crop provision, predator control or habitat quality.

AB  - The release of exotic genotypes into the wild can lead to the extinction of local demes through the hybridization among distinct gene pools. This may occur between wild specimens and their domesticated relatives. Escaped pets represent a well-known pathway for the introduction of allochtonous resources, and island environments require major attention as they include small-sized and naive populations that may be prone to extinction. We characterized the genetic make-up of the black francolin (Francolinus francolinus, Phasianidae) resident to Cyprus using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA for the purpose of sustainable use and long-term protection of this game species. We collected 59 samples of specimens hunted in the districts of Nicosia and Paphos, while others (n= 18) were obtained from birds of unknown origin. These had been imported to a pet-centre in Nicosia, the largest in the capital offering animals either for production or leisure purposes. Both genetic systems pointed to the occurrence of distinct wild district populations that could be treated as separate management units. The non-significant value of the inbreeding coefficient (F-IS) computed for Nicosia and Paphos populations (-0.039 and 0.189, respectively: P > 0.05) and the lack of evidence for recent genetic bottlenecks did not indicate a serious risk of over-hunting. The microsatellites revealed the birds in the pet-centre as highly genetically divergent with respect to the wild ones, the mtDNA pointed to their assignment to alien Asian subspecies once they were compared to 141 sequences of allopatric francolins. We advised the Game & Fauna Service to consider law enforcement to ban the import, detention and sale of these subspecies to protect the black francolin population native to Cyprus. The results are discussed in the context of a bibliographic frame including the partridges of the genus Alectoris (Phasianidae) as a model group with reference to genetic characterization and conservation of game bird island populations.

AB  - For invasion ecology to become a quantitative approach to conservation, robust predictors of success must be identified Taxonomy although often casually mentioned, has never been thoroughly assessed as all agent of prediction. I used binomial probabilities to identify taxonomic patterns in establishment success among global avifauna. At most, 2.54% of all avian species are considered successfully established exotics somewhere in the world. The distribution of these species among higher taxa is far from random. Seven families contained more successfully established exotic species than expected by chance: Anatidae (ducks and geese), Phasianidae (pheasants), Passeridae (sparrows and estrildid finches), Psittacidae (parrots and allies), Columbidae (pigeons and doves), Rheidae (rheas), and Odontophoridae (New World quails). Human influence on probability of transport appears to drive this taxonomic pattern. Anatidae, Odontophoridae, and Phasianidae hold far more species than expected that arrived in their invasive range for exploitation (i.e., hunting or game). Passeridae and Sturnidae (starlings and mynahs) have more pet species than expected by chance. This, traits that enhance probability of purposeful transport exhibit a taxonomic pattern, This human influence on probability of transport increases the quantity of species introduced but does not increase the proportion of species that successfully become established. When invasion risk is assigned, it is vital to understand the interaction between species-specific attributes that influence established and transportation.

AB  - Helminths have often been considered responsible in driving partially wildlife population density fluctuations; therefore more information have to be achieved when target hosts are endangered or threatened species, such as black grouse (Tetrao tetrix). During 8 years (2003-2010), we collected and analyzed 431 intestinal contents of hunted black grouse from Central Alps (Verbania), recording age, body weights, biometric measures, and the culling site to investigate (1) their helminth community structure, (2) how much infection varies in relation to age class and to prealpine and alpine origin area, and (3) if parasites may act as population destabilizing factors. The helminth community is composed by two nematodes Ascaridia compar and Aonchotheca caudinflata. A. compar is the predominant species, and a significant higher intensity of both helminths is recorded in juveniles. A. caudinflata has a negative effect on weights of all the population subjects (p<0.001), independently of age and origin area. Prealpine population, characterized by significantly lower weights than those of the alpine ones (p<0.05), is found more infected by both helminths, with also a negative impact (p<0.001) of A. compar recorded on prealpine adults' weights. The negative effect noticed for A. caudinflata emphasizes its pathogenicity and shows that this infection can be considered a further stressor for the studied population. Moreover, A. compar affects essentially adults in prealpine area and this fact, together with the major infection of the entire prealpine population, supports the hypothesis that habitat characteristics play a role in the infectious process.

AB  - Release of Galliformes species is common management practice in Europe and North America. Here, we attempt to synthesise available information on the release of wild-caught and captive-reared galliforms, and discuss flow rearing and release techniques affect release success. Galliforms are released into the wild to increase hunted populations with after-hunting-season releases, to establish new populations, to augment threatened populations, and to be used for 'put and take' shooting. We conclude that the release of artificially reared galliforms after the hunting season is not suitable practice to increase an already viable population. Release for 'put and take' shooting is ail alienated form of hunting, and it raises ethical questions. 'Put and take' should be strictly examined in the context of wildlife conservation, hunting culture, philosophy and economy. In the case Of Population establishment and augmentation, translocation of wild-caught birds is by far the best choice. The alternative choice is release of naturally or semi-naturally reared birds and anti-predator trained birds. Galliform release should not be a stereotyped process with many failures, but rather a practice in which correct techniques are used for the pursued aim.

AB  - Game management is widely implemented in Spain, affecting more than 70 % of land cover. Management intensity may be linked to the financial aims of hunting estates, but no study of these aspects has been developed in Spain, where commercial hunting is common. Through interviews with game managers and field surveys, we quantified physical and economic traits, management techniques, and hunting methods in a sample of 59 small-game hunting estates located in south-central Spain (where red-legged partridge hunting has the highest socioeconomic importance in the country). We compared non-commercial estates (aimed for leisure, managed mainly by local hunting societies) and commercial estates (aimed at financial benefit); among the latter, we also assessed "intensive" estates (a special category of commercial estates licensed to release farm-reared partridges without temporal or numerical limits throughout the hunting season). Commercial estates had more intensive management, including more and larger partridge releases, higher density of supplementary feeders and more intensive predator control. Thus, any positive or negative effects on biodiversity of these management techniques would be higher in commercial than in non-commercial estates. Commercial estates also retained more natural vegetation, which may help to enhance the landscape and biodiversity value of farmland in central Spain. On the other hand, differences in management and hunting styles were most marked between intensive and other type of estates (both commercial and non-commercial); this indicates that intensive estates are qualitatively different from other small-game estates, both ecologically (hunting based on releases and driven shooting) and economically (higher inputs and outputs). It would be desirable to find ways to quantify the environmental or social costs and benefits of different management techniques, and integrate them in the economics of hunting estates.

AB  - Global climate change has led to range shifts in plants and animals, thus threatening biodiversity. Latitudinal shifts have been shown to be more pronounced than elevational shifts, implying that northern range edge margins may be more capable to keeping pace with warming than upper elevational limits. Additionally, global climate change is expected to disadvantage habitat specialists. In the Alps, climatic variation along the elevation gradient allows the coexistence of habitat specialists and generalists. Alpine species are anticipated to adapt their elevational ranges to the change of various climate variables caused by global climate change. Regional differences might buffer elevational shifts. Furthermore, distinct climate variables might differently affect the shifts of habitat specialists and generalists. To study the effect of climate change on Alpine species, we analysed hunting bag, climate and biogeographical data of two grouse species (Tetrao tetrix and Lagopus muta) and two hare species (Lepus timidus varronis and L. europaeus) in Grisons, Switzerland, over a period of 30 years. Our results based on 84,630 harvested specimens were as follows: (1) only three out of seven climate variables changed significantly within the study period. (2) The grouse species significantly shifted towards higher elevations, whereas the hare species only shifted in their minimum/maximum elevations. (3) Hunting elevation of habitat generalists increased more than in habitat specialists. (4) The elevational shifts were mostly related to the number of frost days. (5) Hunting elevation increased especially in the southern biogeographical region. To conclude, all four taxa respond to climate change but habitat generalists more rapidly than habitat specialists. The range shift to higher elevations due to global climate change will lead to a reduction in habitat availability for snow-adapted species. Climate change is thus a serious threat to alpine biodiversity. Regions rich in alpine habitats will have an increased responsibility to conserve these species.

AB  - In southern Europe, traditional hunting has been frequently replaced by models based on more intensive management. These systems include Management strategies like the release of farm-reared animals that can cause harmful effects on biodiversity. However, little is known about the hunters' views of this activity, and about their preferences for the ecological attributes of the hunting estates. We present the results of a choice experiment exercise evaluating the willingness to pay of Spanish hunters regarding different aspects of walked-up red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) shooting, including partridge quality (farm-reared vs. wild) and other attributes related to the ecological characteristics of the estate. We find that, when given the choice, hunting an additional wild partridge in a walked-up shooting day was valued more than 20 times higher than hunting an additional farm-reared bird. The diversity of small game available and the presence of natural vegetation in the landscape in which the walked-up hunting takes place were also significantly valued. Hunters also attributed economic value (albeit lower than other attributes) to the presence of protected non-game fauna in the estate. Overall, our results show that hunters are willing to pay more for hunting on estates that have better ecological characteristics, which may be indicative of good conservation status. This suggests that identifying and promoting such estates could lead to systems that are both ecologically and economically sustainable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus; i.e., pheasant) hunting participation is declining across North America, reflecting a larger downward trend in American hunting participation and threatening benefits to grassland conservation and rural economies. To stabilize and expand the pheasant hunting population, we must first identify factors that influence pheasant hunter participation. We used an extensive in-person hunter survey to test the hypothesis that hunter demographics interact with social-ecological traits of hunting locations to affect hunter decisions, outcomes, and perceptions. We built a series of Bayesian mixed effects models to parse variation in demographics, perceptions, and hunt outcomes of pheasant hunters interviewed at public access hunting sites across 3 regions in Nebraska, USA, that varied in pheasant abundance and proximity to urban population centers. Among pheasant hunters in Nebraska, access to private lands was negatively related to the human population density of a pheasant hunter's home ZIP code and the distance a hunter had traveled to reach a hunting location. Pheasant hunters interviewed closer to metropolitan areas tended to be more urban and travel shorter distances, and their parties were more likely to include youth but less likely to include dogs. Hunter satisfaction was positively associated with seeing and harvesting pheasants and hunting with youth. Whereas youth participation and the number of pheasants seen varied by study region, hunter satisfaction did not differ across regions, suggesting that hunters may calibrate their expectations and build their parties based on where they plan to hunt. The variation in hunter demographics across hunting locations and disconnects between social and ecological correlates of hunter satisfaction suggests that diverse pheasant hunting constituencies will be best served by diverse pheasant hunting opportunities.

AB  - Survival rates are necessary for calculating allowable harvests and for modelling population performance. Survival rates for 93 black grouse Tetrao tetrix equipped with radio tags in two populations of the southern French Alps were estimated. Annual survival rates of hens (0.68, SE = 0.075, 0.84, SE = 0.105), but not of cocks (0.56, SE = 0.09, 0.66, SE = 0.122), tended to be higher than those of juveniles (0.52, SE = 0.071, sexes combined). The lower survival of juveniles was due to higher predation, mostly by raptors, in autumn and winter. Although both autumn and winter were seasons of peak mortality in juveniles, most adult deaths occurred either in spring (hens and cocks), or in early summer (cocks). Causes of mortality were as follows: raptors 51%, mammalian predators 27%, unidentified predators 11%, and hunting 11%. Principal raptors were golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and goshawk Accipiter gentilis. Mammalian predators included fox Vulpes vulpes, pine marten Martes manes and stone marten M. foina. Only males could be legally shot, and hunting was a minor mortality factor on our study areas. Nevertheless, the distorted adult sex ratio favouring hens that we observed on our study areas was probably due to hunting of males on and around the study areas. Sensitivity analysis showed that population growth is influenced more by adult survival than by either reproductive success or juvenile survival to one year of age. To prevent shooting from causing highly distorted spring sex ratios, which might compromise reproductive success, harvests should be reduced in years of poor reproduction, and shooting should be oriented towards juvenile males.

AB  - Southeast Asia has arguably the highest biodiversity loss due to the high deforestation rate and hunting pressure. In the region, 55 species of the family Phasianidae can be found in all available land habitats from lowland plains up to high-elevation mountainous areas. As ground-dwelling birds, these species are sensitive to habitat disturbance and hunting pressure, making them ideal to evaluate the status of remaining Southeast Asian forest habitats. The aims of this work are, therefore, to define for each Phasianidae species: (1) the extent of forest cover, suitable habitat and large forest patches currently available in the region and their decline over the years between 2000 and 2018 (six estimated generations) and (2) assess the threats using a Bayesian Belief Network approach combining data on forest loss hotspots and hunting pressure. Moreover, we defined the spatial distribution of Phasianidae diversity hotspots and relative threats in the region. The results show that over the 18-year study period, the forest cover, suitable habitat and Phasianidae diversity in Southeast Asia declined overall. The remaining forest habitats currently have low species diversity and face medium to high threat levels from habitat loss and hunting pressure. Population monitoring and higher protection levels both inside and outside protected areas are essential for the species' long term survival. We recommend using Phasianidae as indicator species to monitor the overall habitat conservation status in Southeast Asia.

AB  - We mailed survey questionnaires to 62 upland game bird managers in the United States and Canada in 2004. We received questionnaires from 47 of the 62 (76%) upland game bird managers that were contacted and 43 (91%) respondents provided information on how monitoring data were used. Responses indicated monitoring programs (population trends and/or harvest monitoring) for 23 species of Galliformes, with 145 +/- 208 personnel days/year devoted to monitoring. Estimating general population trends (e.g. up or down) was the most frequent objective (N=41; 95%) of survey data. Other applications of data included assessments of hunting activity, evaluations of regional programs and reviews of conservation status related to Endangered Species Act petitions. The majority of respondents (i.e. 63%) with monitoring programs considered the programs within their states to be effective with respect to their objectives. Many states rely upon hunter surveys, harvest data or road counts to access demographic and population data to address major conservation and management issues. The relevance of these issues is growing and agencies must respond with management recommendations, but often must do so with limited data on the status of their populations. Comprehensive monitoring should be a major component of conservation and management planning for upland gamebird populations particularly as a tool to track and evaluate the effectiveness of management actions and inform management options.

AB  - A landscape-scale assessment of how bobwhite productivity varies in relation to weather does not exist for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We collected age and sex ratio and body mass data from hunter-harvested bobwhites in 16 counties of South Texas (n=72,797 bobwhites) during 20012009 hunting seasons. We evaluated annual bobwhite production (juvenile:adult age ratios) as a function of cumulative AprilAugust rainfall using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather station data from Falfurrias and Hebbronville, Texas. We observed minimal among-year change in percent males harvested (51.054.5% male) and mean mass (156160g) of bobwhites across South Texas. We found no relationship between percent male or body mass and weather. We documented a positive, linear relationship between cumulative AprilAugust rainfall and bobwhite age ratios (r2=0.94); we also documented a negative, linear relationship between summer (JunAug) mean maximum daily temperature and bobwhite age ratios (r2=0.38). Our results suggest that rainfall is a landscape-scale indicator of annual bobwhite production in South Texas and can thus be used to manage annual expectations of quail hunters prior to the hunting season.

AB  - Human hunting activity and disturbance can significantly impact prey species through both consumptive and nonconsumptive effects. The nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) are currently unknown. Increased perceived risk of predation by bobwhite during rabbit hunting events may elicit antipredator responses among bobwhite that impact fitness via changes in behavior that ultimately impact population growth. We estimated the nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on bobwhite behavior using telemetry across varying rabbit hunting intensities. Movements were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical modeling with a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to determine the effect of rabbit hunting on bobwhite. We observed an overall reduction in bobwhite movement in the presence of rabbit hunting, with a 38% (Posterior Overlap = 0.01) increase in bobwhite step length in the absence of rabbit hunting. We also observed bobwhite maintaining closer proximity to hardwood and escape cover under high rabbit hunting intensity, with a 59% (Posterior Overlap = 0.03) increase in distance from hardwood and a 28% (Posterior Overlap = 0.14) increase in distance from escape cover when rabbit hunting was removed. Synthesis and applications. Heightened antipredator behavior through decreased movement may assist with bobwhite predator avoidance. However, decreased movement and increased use of poor habitats may also have negative effects as a result of reduced foraging time or increased susceptibility to other predators. Future research should attempt to quantify the effect of decreased movement on bobwhite fitness through the evaluation of foraging time and survival in order to continue to improve management efforts for the species.

AB  - We examined the effects of habitat distribution, age, sex, and body mass on variation in seasonal home ranges of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris). During 1992-94 we obtained and analyzed 11,354 locations of 156 wild turkeys in the Arkansas Ozarks. In particular, we tested the prediction that home range size and seasonal range juxtaposition covary with social status and physiological condition of an individual. Participation in breeding, age, and body mass strongly influenced spring and summer range sizes and range use in both sexes. As predicted, adult wild turkeys had smaller home ranges during the breeding season and greater overlap among seasonal ranges than yearlings. Successful females had a higher probability of using their breeding area during fall and winter than unsuccessful females. Habitat availability and distribution and acorn harvest were significant correlates of winter range size and use for females. Spring and prenesting ranges of females in our study area were the largest reported for eastern wild turkeys. We attributed this pattern to high nest predation which might cause extensive nest site selection movements.

AB  - The ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) is one of the most popular small game species both numerically and economically. Pheasant populations are commonly managed in the Czech Republic in order to maximize their harvest. Game managers need to be aware of the possible effects of different management tools on wild pheasant populations. We used data from 38 hunting grounds collected over an 8-year period (2004-2011) and generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) to assess whether pheasant harvest was related to the habitat characteristics and game management practices (release of hand-reared individuals and predator control) in the Czech Republic. The proportion of grasslands, idle lands (spontaneously set-aside lands), and organically farmed lands (i.e., with limited use of industrially made fertilizers and pesticides) and the density of watercourses were positively related to the pheasant harvest. The proportion of forests and road density showed a negative relationship with the pheasant harvest. An important effect of year on the pheasant harvest was also found. In terms of game management practices, predator control intensity (i.e., foxes, martens, corvids) was positively related to the pheasant harvest. The release of hand-reared individuals was not included in the final GLMMs. Our study suggests that the best long-term strategy to reinforce the wild population of ring-necked pheasants would be to concentrate on habitat improvement through the implementation of set-aside management, maintaining the right percentage of shrubby and grass vegetation, to continue with targeted predator control, and to reduce the costly practice of releasing of hand-reared individuals.

AB  - c The Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is an important gamebird among hunters that has been experiencing a nationwide decline for > 50 yr. In West Texas, one of the last regions to experience this downward trend, research on bobwhite populations has focused on habitat variables and, increasingly, on parasitic infection. In bobwhite, two of the most common parasites are the caecal worm (Aulonocephalus pennula) and eyeworm (Oxyspirura petrowi). To better document the state of bobwhite populations in the Rolling Plains Ecoregion, trapping, summer rooster counts, fall covey counts, and parasitic infection assessments were conducted in three counties during 2018. These efforts were compared with previous years for a longitudinal perspective. In 2018, bobwhite populations experienced a widespread decline, although some counties surveyed fared slightly better than others. More effort was required to trap fewer total bobwhite, and fewer roosters and coveys were counted than in previous years. In addition, in 2018, parasitic infection levels of caecal and eyeworms were higher than or similar to levels in previous years. Additional research is necessary to understand which factors influence bobwhite populations in allopatric locations and over time. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) depend on ephemeral habitats, which are constantly changing in quality and spatial structure. Given recent changes in agricultural practices in the Midwest, habitat patches on the landscape are undoubtedly occurring in new configurations, presenting new challenges to bobwhite. Yet, little is known about dispersal capabilities of bobwhite in Illinois where widespread change in land use has coincided with population declines. Since effective dispersal results in gene flow, we investigated the genetic population structure of bobwhite in Illinois using 11 DNA microsatellite loci. We analyzed bobwhite collected by hunters in southern and central counties of Illinois at 6 sampling areas separated by 27-276km. We found a significant but low amount of genetic structure (F-ST=0.009). We used multiple genetic analysis methods (F-ST, PCA, STRUCTURE, and Mantel tests) to gain greater insights into genetic structure. Patterns of differentiation did not correspond to those expected from an isolation-by-distance pattern. Genetic introgression from stock source birds was not strongly indicated. The low amount of population structure detected may be an early indication of genetic drift occurring due to recent landscape changes that may be isolating bobwhite subpopulations. Future sampling when more time has elapsed will help resolve where these subpopulations lie on the continuum between complete isolation and panmixia. (c) 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - We examined survival of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) occupying fragmented landscapes within the Prairie Pothole Region in South Dakota, USA, where severe winter weather events historically limited pheasant population growth through increased mortality. Recent landscape transformations could further affect overwinter adult female survival by reducing critical winter resources. Assessing the influence of time-dependent landscape features on survival at small focal scales may reveal spatially important relationships. We captured and monitored 321 adult female pheasants from 2017-2019 and recorded 110 pheasant winter mortalities. Female pheasant winter survival was 0.66 (85% CI = 0.62-0.70) and was inversely correlated to snow depth. We generated Cox proportional hazard models to determine risk of mortality associated with landscape features. Pheasants using landscapes other than perennial cover (i.e., emergent wetland, tall vegetation, woody, food plots) experienced a 2.22 times greater risk of raptor predation than pheasants using perennial cover. Additionally, pheasants experienced a 58% reduced risk of weather mortality when using emergent wetlands. We analyzed resource selection ratios to understand how perceived landscape risks at the population level scaled down to land use selection at the individual level. Female pheasants selected for emergent wetlands, showed no selection for woody features, and avoided tall vegetation (non-aquatic herbaceous vegetation >75 cm) during severe winters. Pheasants would greatly benefit from conservation of emergent wetlands and integrating perennial cover into harvested cropland.

AB  - Nielsen, O. K. & Petursson, G. 1995: Population fluctuations of gyrfalcon and rock ptarmigan: analysis of export figures from Iceland. - Wildl. Biol. 1: 65-71. We analysed harvest data for gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus and rock ptarmigan Lagopus mutus from Iceland with respect to regularity in fluctuations of numbers. The gyrfalcon data concerned live trapped birds exported to Denmark between 1731 and 1793, and totalled 4,848 falcons, including 4,318 grey, 156 half-white and 374 white colour morphs. According to contemporary sources grey birds were part of the local breeding population (islandus-type birds) but the other morphs represented mainly visitors from Greenland. This is also the current situation but some of the lightest Icelandic breeders could be classified as half-white. The rock ptarmigan harvest data concerned birds exported to Europe in the period 1864-1919, in total ca 3.3 million birds. The data series for white and half-white gyrfalcons were significantly correlated (r = 0.501, p < 0.001). The data series for grey and white morphs (r = -0.099, P = 0.445) and grey and the half-white morphs (r = -0.1183, P = 0.360), showed no correlation. Time series analysis showed that the white (candicans-type) morph fluctuated irregularly. The half-white morph behaved similarly but also showed some affinity with the grey morph, and could have represented a mixture of local breeders and Greenlandic winter visitors. Grey morph gyrfalcons and rock ptarmigan showed regular fluctuations in numbers with a 10-year periodicity. The reliance of Icelandic gyrfalcons on rock ptarmigan during the early part of the breeding season and in all phases of the ptarmigan cycle is well established and may offer a case for causal connections between the two cyclic populations.

AB  - Finnish populations of the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, black grouse Lyrurus tetrix and hazel grouse Tetrastes bonasia have been fluctuating in synchronous cycles. Mechanisms behind these fluctuations are not well known. Parasites may regulate their host population under certain conditions. The Finnish grouse harbour several species of intestinal parasites which may affect the populations. We studied the possibility of parasitic regulation in Finnish forest grouse using intestinal samples from hunted grouse collected in 1995-2000 and annual counts of grouse densities. We found that abundance and prevalence of the nematode Ascaridia compar affected negatively the grouse-community growth rate (all three species combined) and annual survival of grouse. In years of grouse density decline, the prevalence and abundance of A. compar was considerably higher than in other years. On the species level, this dynamic was most clearly seen in the capercaillie. The findings suggest the possibility of parasitic regulation by A. compar in the Finnish forest grouse community.

AB  - Wild red-legged partridge populations have experienced important declines in recent decades. With an aim to increase or maintain hunting quotas, releases of farm-reared red-legged partridges have concomitantly increased. However, the sustainability of this management practice is increasingly questioned. Farm-reared partridges suffer a high mortality rate immediately after release, and many released birds may already be dead before hunting takes place. Therefore, it is possible that if hunters adjust harvest to the number of farm-reared released birds, this may lead to an overhunting of the wild breeding stocks. We investigated here whether autumn mortality by hunting of radio-tracked birds that bred in the previous summer differed between hunting estates that use or do not use releases as part of their management practices. Although our sample size was limited (32 radio-tagged birds monitored throughout the hunting season in four estates, with only one conducting releases), our results report novel data that support this cause for concern. We found that hunting was the main cause of mortality and that the proportion of hunted partridges was much higher in the estate with releases of farm-reared birds than in the three estates that did not use releases. Therefore, the release of farm-reared partridges, instead of reducing hunting pressure on the breeding stock through a potential dilution effect, may have an opposite effect. This should be confirmed with more spatial replicates, but raises serious concerns regarding the long term sustainability of wild partridge populations and their exploitation for hunting purposes in estates that overhunt partridge populations due to releases.

AB  - We assessed the status and trends of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations in Ohio from 1984-2004(21 years). Bobwhite abundance indices were obtained from surveys conducted on secondary roads. The number of roads surveyed per year ranged from 69 to 209 (with 12 stops each). We used Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations and a Generalized Additive Model to analyze bobwhite population trends. Bobwhite populations in Ohio declined 9.3% / year (95% Cl = 7.3% -11.2%). Overall, populations declined 76% (95% CI=68-82%) over the 21-year period. We also compared annual trends during the same period among 10 weather regions in the state. At least six weather regions showed declining population trends, but analyses for the remaining four regions were inconclusive. We mapped the distribution and abundance of bobwhites in Ohio using abundance indices from surveys conducted during 1985, 1992, and 2002. These maps revealed that the bobwhite range contracted as populations declined during 1984-2004. The current core area of bobwhite abundance is located in Southwestern Ohio, where 16 counties are open for hunting. However, bobwhite distribution shifted eastward within Southwestern Ohio during 1984-2004. Adjacent counties that are currently closed to hunting lie mostly outside the highest abundance zone. We recommend bobwhite population surveys of high resolution on counties open to hunting, as well as surrounding counties where hunting has recently been closed. However, lower resolution efforts, such as site occupancy surveys, should be conducted outside those areas to detect range expansion.

AB  - Widespread declines of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations may reflect habitat alteration at both site and landscape level. To investigate the latter, we quantified landscape composition and pattern throughout Illinois (>145,900 km(2)) using classified satellite imagery and FRAGSTATS software. We then compared landscape structure with indexes of northern bobwhite abundance using county-level harvest and North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. Analyses at both scales suggested bobwhite were primarily associated with diverse, patchy landscapes that contained moderate amounts of grassland and row crops and abundant woody edge. These findings were used to develop a PATREC model to identify and map Illinois landscapes potentially suitable for bobwhite. Whether or not such areas actually support good bobwhite populations depends upon site conditions generally not discernable by remote sensing. Nevertheless, knowledge of the extent and distribution of potentially suitable landscapes can enhance and focus management efforts.

AB  - The Caucasian grouse Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi, one of the most poorly known species of grouse, is experiencing population declines associated with multiple threats. Evaluating species' population status in relation to different local human activities is important to inform conservation and identify suitable management methods, but determining status and threats for poorly known taxa may require assessment of non-standard sources of ecological information. We investigated what novel insights can be provided by local ecological knowledge (LEK) about population status and threats to the Caucasian grouse, in relation to the comparative status of other co-occurring wildlife and to different local land-use activities, and how data on local awareness and attitudes can guide conservation planning for this species. We conducted an interview survey in rural communities in the Arasbaran Biosphere Reserve (ABR), Iran, and collected LEK from 95 respondents within villages situated close to the locations of surviving and extirpated grouse populations. LEK is a useful tool for assessing the status of grouse populations: 41.1% of respondents recognized grouse and 30.5% had seen the species, and respondents within villages situated close to surviving grouse populations had greater awareness, sighting likelihood, and more recent sightings. More respondents considered that grouse and other galliforms had declined in comparison to other wildlife. Decline and disappearance of grouse populations is associated with alteration and disturbance of grouse habitat, with potential drivers including increased cattle grazing and local bans on harvesting fodder. These findings provide a new baseline to guide the development of suitable grassland management strategies (e.g. grazing regimes) for this species, and highlight the importance of further assessment of the effects of habitat disturbance on grouse survival, including understanding local histories of human-environmental interaction. Current landscape management methods are not supported by local people within the ABR, with most respondents disagreeing with the strict conservation measures currently in place, and we recommend that a new management system should be developed for Caucasian grouse conservation, including targeted conservation education and involving local community participation and co-management.

AB  - Red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) populations have significantly declined in the Iberian Peninsula (by > 50% between 1973 and 2002). This decline has been attributed to the drastic changes that have occurred in traditional agricultural landscapes, among other factors. This paper assesses the relationship between landscape change and the changes in areas favourable to partridges. The areas favourable to partridges in Andalusia (southern Spain), and the environmental and land-use factors that determined these areas, were identified for both the 1960s and the 1990s. Land-use changes were analysed both throughout the study area and for areas where favourability for partridges has either improved or worsened during recent decades. Both the location and the factors determining areas favourable to red-legged partridges have changed substantially over recent decades. In the 1960s, areas favourable to partridges were associated mainly with natural vegetation in mountainous areas, whereas, by the 1990s, favourable areas were associated with large low-lying croplands; such change may be attributable to regional land-use changes. The percentage area of the main natural vegetation variables positively correlated to partridge favourability in the 1960s model (mainly pastures and open scrubland) had decreased in areas that had become unfavourable to the species (such as mountain areas), and risen where partridge favourability increased. By the 1990s, the land area favourable to partridges had decreased by c. 10% (c. 6000 km(2)) in southern Spain, whereas land use unfavourable to partridges markedly increased (> 100%; an increase of c. 3000 km(2)). Landscape suitable for partridges has thus become severely impoverished over recent decades in the Iberian Peninsula. Management measures aimed at improving the landscape for farmland birds should be encouraged to conserve red-legged partridge populations in southern Spain.

AB  - The flight behavior and cover use of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) have been examined in several studies, but the current data lack quantitative measures of how bobwhites respond to natural threats. We examined aspects of bobwhite behavior in response to 4 threat categories: researcher, hunter, raptor, and mammal. We found that bobwhite flight distance is best predicted by threat type and covey size, and bobwhite flight speed is best predicted by threat type. Bobwhites flushed by the hunter threat and the raptor threat selected for significantly taller obstruction at landing sites than was randomly available, with average heights of 6.2cm taller (P=0.034), and 38.1cm taller (P<0.001), respectively. Raptor-flushed bobwhites also selected for significantly denser shrub cover (42.2%, P<0.001) and a lower angle of obstruction (70.4 degrees, P<0.001) at landing points than was randomly available. In the process of data collection, we also observed bobwhite roost locations have lower visual height obstruction (7.3cm, P=0.03), lower shrub intercept (10.1%, P=0.02), and greater angles of obstruction (18.5 degrees, P=0.005) than bobwhite diurnal locations; this may facilitate escape from nocturnal mammalian predators. Our results suggest that bobwhite escape strategies and cover use vary among threat types. These results support current management recommendations of creating a patchwork of vegetation covers for bobwhites but also suggest how a more complete understanding of bobwhite behavior would improve management and conservation efforts.

AB  - The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is the only indigenous Alectoris species in the Iberian Peninsula. Local populations are often reinforced with captive-bred individuals, sometimes including hybrids between the red-legged partridge and the exotic rock partridge (A. graeca). Hunters and wildlife managers oppose releases of hybrids, but their identification by visual inspection is difficult beyond the first hybrid generation. Here we report the development of a set of RAPD markers to identify hybrid partridges using blood samples. We initially screened 46 RAPD primers on a subsample of pure red-legged and rock partridges, and finally selected six primers that produced 11 markers specific of the rock partridge. The selected primers were tested on hybrids of different generations bred in captivity. This set of loci permitted the detection of 100% (n = 31) Fl hybrids, 100% (n = 14) backcrosses of Fl to red-legged partridge, all but one (95%, n = 18) hybrid of the second backcross, and 18 out of 27 (67%, n = 27) hybrids of the third backcross. Efficient detection of backcross 1 and 2 individuals is essential, as these are the ones released for re-stocking purposes in hunting states. Although we have only used blood samples, other sources of high-quality DNA, such as muscle, should provide the same results. Therefore, it would be feasible to monitor the genetic purity of partridges in farms and hunting states at different stages of production, including embryos, chicks or hunted specimens.

AB  - Chukar and gray partridge are abundant and sympatric in Hells Canyon, Idaho and Oregon. We collected crops (birds collected during the hunting season) from both species to compare fall and winter food habits, which allowed for comparison of food selection, estimation of niche overlap, and identification of important food resources. We collected 143 chukar and 112 gray partridge crops during the 1999 and 2000 hunting seasons (late September through early January). We identified 21 items consumed by chukar and 16 items consumed by gray partridge. Both bird species consumed similar foods, with an 80% dietary overlap. Dominant food items for both species included prairiestar root nodules and vegetative parts from various grasses and forbs. Food items differed between years, which may have reflected variation in weather and plant cycles. This is the first study of gray partridge from a non-agricultural environment, and the first rigorous comparison of food habits for sympatric chukar and gray partridge population in North America.

AB  - We re-evaluated the relationship between territorial Svalbard rock ptarmigan male presence and ecological relevant variables related to vegetation, terrain and snowmelt, building on the lessons learned from a previous regional habitat multi-scale model, to predict breeding habitat suitability of this high-arctic, endemic ptarmigan on a large spatial scale. We used 11 years (2000-2010) of presence/absence data of territorial males, a multi-scale generalized linear modelling framework (glms) and recent advances in digital satellite based vegetation mapping. The final habitat model contained four significant predictors related to vegetation, terrain (elevation and slope) and a heat load index, as a proxy for snowmelt. Increasing amount of one particular habitat type, 'established dense Dryas heath' influenced habitat suitability positively at a small scale, while gentle sloping landscapes of intermediate steepness (10-25 degrees) and elevation in the upper southwest facing part of the mountain slopes characterized occurrence at the landscape scale. The best model attained a relatively high explanatory power with a good ability to discriminate correctly between used and available sites. We extrapolated the habitat model to all parts of Spitsbergen with a current growing season sufficiently long for ptarmigan to complete a breeding cycle. The model indicates that only a small proportion of the vegetation covered land area (similar to 3.9%) is highly suitable for ptarmigan. In Svalbard the ptarmigan is an attractive game species, appears in low densities with low annual survival, has restricted availability of breeding habitat and is likely vulnerable to climate change. In such contexts, we suggest to use our predictive habitat model in harvest management of the species so that hunting quotas and efforts may be adjusted to habitat suitability, indicating the reproductive potential, in the hunting areas.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare, within 3-week cold storage, the content of eight biogenic amines (BA) and the development of microflora in different parts of bodies (breast and thigh muscles and liver) of farm pheasants and pheasants hunted in the wild. Killed and untreated bodies of pheasants were stored hanging in an air-conditioned chamber at a cold temperature (5 +/- 1 A degrees C). The pheasant bodies were subjected to microbiological analysis and identification of isolated microorganisms whose decarboxylase activity was detected. The production of biogenic amines and polyamines was determined by means of HPLC after pre-column derivatisation with dansylchloride. The total number of microorganisms in all parts of the pheasant bodies as well as the number of psychrotrophic bacteria, enterobacteria and lactic acid bacteria was increasing during storage (P < 0.05). A total of 127 strains of bacteria from the pheasant bodies were isolated and identified. Production of at least one biogenic amine was found in vitro in 107 isolates. Three strains were found to produce four biogenic amines-histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine. Production of phenylethylamine, tryptamine, spermidine and spermine in the isolated bacteria was not detected. Within all the biogenic amines detected in the analysed samples of pheasant bodies, the lowest concentration was found in histamine and the highest one in tyramine and cadaverine. The amount of BA detected in the individual parts of pheasant bodies was increasing during the storage period. The total amounts of seven biogenic amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine, cadaverine, phenylethylamine, spermidine and spermine) in the individual parts of pheasant bodies were ranging between 9 and 708 mg/kg.

AB  - Simple Summary The Himalayan pheasants have many cultural, economic, and environmental values. Still, unfortunately, the species is under anthropogenic pressure and biological hazards, leading to a rapid decline in its population. The current study aims to identify the human pressures imposed by major infrastructure development projects, illegal hunting, deforestation, pollution, non-timber forest collections, and other natural activities that severely damage the pheasant habitat and population in the study area. Higher altitude valleys with less disturbed habitats have significantly higher encounter rates and densities than those at lower altitudes and higher human pressure. This research suggests that conservation biologists and the wildlife department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should formulate approaches for effective conservation and better habitat management. It may include public awareness regarding pheasant's beneficial aspects, pre-implementations of the wildlife management plan for a major infrastructure development project, and strict rules and policies around deforestation and habitat degradation. The study also recommends that the habitat of the pheasants, specifically the threatened area of Western Tragopan, be considered a legally reserved area of conservation to improve its conservation status. Pheasants play a distinctive and significant role in high altitudinal ecosystems. These are good indicators of environmental changes, and their presence determines the health and balance of the bio-network. Recent human pressure continues to degrade their populations, and some pheasant species are already extinct. Therefore, the current study focuses on pheasant abundance and emerging conservation issues. The pheasant population was assessed using "Call count methods" and analyzed by DISTANCE software. The results revealed that the valleys where human interference is minimum had significantly higher encounter rates and densities of pheasants. At the same time, the pheasant population was severely affected, whether found at lower or higher altitudes, showing seasonal migration toward human settlements. The habitat suitability modeling was performed using the MaxEnt model and showed that human activities overlap with the suitable natural habitats of pheasants. The threats were identified using a systematic questionnaire survey from the nearest villages of the potential habitat, and particular attention was paid to valleys where human pressures were found to be high. Major infrastructure development projects, illegal hunting, and deforestation were identified as the major threats to the pheasant population. The study concluded that proper conservation measures are required to protect pheasants in their potential habitats.

AB  - Knowing the ecology of game species is important to define sustainable hunting pressure and to plan management actions aimed to maintain viable populations. Common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) is one of the main gamebird species in Europe and North America, despite its native range extending from the Caucasus to Eastern China. This research aimed to define the environmental variables shaping the spatial distribution of male pheasants and to estimate their breeding density in an agroecosystem of northern Italy. During the breeding season, 2015, we carried out 372 point counts with unlimited distances, randomly placed following a stratified sampling survey design. The habitat requirements of the pheasant were evaluated following a presence vs. availability approach, using environmental variables related to land use cover and landscape configuration. We built generalized linear models with a binary distribution, selecting variables following an information-theoretic approach. Densities were estimated through both conventional and multiple-covariate distance sampling. We estimated a density of 1.45 males/km(2), with 4.26 males/km(2) in suitable areas and 0.91 males/km(2) in unsuitable ones. We found pheasants in areas with meadows and tree plantations, which were used to find food and refuges from predators and bad weather conditions. Similarly, woodlands have a positive effect on species occurrence, whereas arable lands were avoided, specifically maize and paddy fields. We found little evidence that landscape configuration affects pheasant occurrence. We found pheasants to be negatively affected by the length of edges between woodlands and arable lands, whereas edges between woodlands and grasslands seem to be beneficial for the species. These findings could help landscape and wildlife managers to plan habitat improvement actions useful to maintain self-sustaining populations of this species, by increasing cover of woodlands, meadows, and tree plantations.

AB  - Three wild red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) from intensively managed hunting areas in Spain were received for necropsy. They showed granulomatous lesions in different parts of the body, mainly in liver and spleen. Microscope examination of the granulomas showed central caseous necrosis and large amounts of acid-fast bacilli, surrounded by epitheloid cells, giant cells, and lymphocytes. Attempts to isolate and culture the bacillus in Colestsos medium were unsuccessful, but the polymerase chain reaction technique revealed the presence of microorganisms belonging to the Mycobacterium avium complex in one of the partridges. This is the first report of avian tuberculosis in free-living red-legged partridges.

AB  - For hunting purposes, several millions of redlegged partridges (Alectoris rufa) are released each year in Spain, and these releases have the potential to introduce new parasites and disease into wild populations. We studied the prevalence of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp. and Salmonella sp. in the intestinal flora of red-legged partridges from three different husbandry groups: farmreared, restocked and natural populations. Prevalence of E. coli was significantly higher in farm-reared (45%, p=0.01) and restocked partridges (60%, p<0.001) than in wild ones (6%, p>0.05). The prevalence of Campylobacter sp. (23%, 100 out of 444) did not differ significantly between these three husbandry groups, and Salmonella sp. was only detected in a group of partridge chicks on one of the farms studied (0.9%, 5 out of 544). These results suggest that farm-reared and restocked partridges can act as carriers of these three enteropathogens and highlight a potential risk of transmission to natural populations via the releases of farm-reared partridges. However, future investigations are needed regarding the relation of the isolated bacteria with zoonotic strains and dissemination of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, especially E. coli, and to better evaluate the effect that these three enteropathogens have on partridge health and on the success of restocking with farm-reared birds.

AB  - Game birds such as pheasants Phasianus colchicus (Horsfield) are bred and released to supplement wild living populations prior to the hunting season. The total bag records of these birds are, therefore, not suitable for monitoring the development of wild populations because they are heavily influenced by game management. Wild and released pheasants can be expected to be genetically similar or identical to wild birds because wild birds are captured and used for breeding. It is, therefore, not possible to use genetic methods for identifying released individuals. Heavy stable isotopes are incorporated in animal tissues in a predictable manner and depend on the concentration of heavy isotopes in the diet. The heavy isotopes C-13 and N-15 accumulate in the food chain because the more common lighter isotopes are excreted at a higher rate than the heavy isotopes. Bred and released pheasant feed on a uniform plant-based diet, and it can, therefore, be expected that these animals have lower and less variable levels of heavy isotopes than individuals from a wild populations which feed on a diverse diet of plants and invertebrates. We investigated the isotope signatures in feathers from wild and released pheasant populations and compared the levels and variation in isotope signature amongst the populations. Bred and released pheasants are clearly identified in comparison to released pheasants as wild types have higher delta N-15.

AB  - Sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.) were abundant in all of Utah's 29 counties at the time of European settlement wherever sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) occurred. Greater Sage-Grouse (C. urophasianus) inhabited areas north and west of the Colorado River, and Gunnison Sage-Grouse (C. minimus) occupied suitable habitat south and east of the Colorado River. The largest Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah are currently restricted to suitable habitats in Box Elder, Garfield, Rich, Uintah, and Wayne Counties. A remnant breeding population of Gunnison Sage-Grouse occurs in eastern San Juan County. We stratified Greater Sage-Grouse populations (1971-2000) by counties where the 1996 to 2000 moving average for estimated spring breeding populations was >500 (GT500) or <500 (LT500). Males per lek declined in all populations from 1971 to 2000; however, there were consistently more males observed on GT500 than on LT500 leks. Juveniles per adult lien (including yearling hens) Greater Sage-Grouse in the 1973-2000 fall harvest in Box Elder, Rich, and Wayne Counties did not differ from 2.25, a ratio suggesting sustainable or increasing sage-grouse populations. Declines are attributed to loss, fragmentation, and degradation of sagebrush habitat. Sage-grouse conservation ultimately depends on management and enhancement of remaining sagebrush rangelnads in Utah.

AB  - The pheasant breeds are widely used for restocking of natural populations depleted by hunting. The pheasant population number decline was detected during the 1970s in many hunting areas of Europe. One of its possible reasons might be the loss of adaptability in populations originating from breeding stations, which was caused by inbreeding depression. The aim of this paper was the analysis of genetic variability in pheasant populations from three breeding stations in Vojvodina province (Serbia) by means of allozyme diversity detection. The allozyme variability analysis of pheasants from all three breeding stations revealed polymorphisms at nine loci: Ldh-1, Mor-1, Mor-2, Es-1, Mod-2, Pgd, Gpi-2, Odh, and Sod. The analysis of individuals from three different breeding stations showed mean values of observed heterozygosity of H (o)=0.137, polymorphism P (95%)=30%, and H/P ratio H/P=0.430, which indicate a normal level of genetic variability for bird populations. Comparative analysis of three pheasant populations showed a high level of interpopulation differentiation.

AB  - Esophagi were removed from northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) that were killed by hunters during the 1996-1997 (n = 39) and 1997-1998 (n = 27) hunting seasons in Wheeler County, Texas and Roger Mills County, Oklahoma to determine if they were exposed to aflatoxin (AF) by consuming either wild or supplemental food. Esophagi were segregated into three categories based upon their contents: all wild seeds (n = 11), all supplemental foods (n = 21), and mixed foods (n = 18). Contents of esophagi were then analyzed for AF concentration. Mean (+/- SE) AF concentration (ppb) of wild seeds was 2.44 +/- 0.54 supplemental foods, 0.12 +/- 0.41; and mixed foods, 0.53 +/- 0.40. Wild seeds had higher (P = 0.004) AF concentrations than either the supplemental or mixed categories, although these levels are below those found to cause damage to northern bobwhite. This information suggests that northern bobwhite may consume contaminated food much more often than previously thought.

AB  - Poult survival is key to understanding annual change in wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations. Survival of eastern wild turkey poults (M. g. silvestris) 0-4 weeks posthatch was studied in southcentral Iowa during 1994-97. Survival estimates of poults were calculated based on biweekly flush counts and daily locations acquired via radiotelemetry. Poult survival averaged 0.52 +/- 0.14% ((x) over bar +/- SE) for telemetry counts and 0.40 +/- 0.15 for flush counts. No within-year or across-year differences were detected between estimation techniques, More than 72% (n = 32) of documented poult mortality occurred less than or equal to 14 days posthatch, and mammalian predation accounted for 92.9% of documented mortality. If mortality agents are not of concern, we suggest biologists conduct 4-week flush counts to obtain poult survival estimates for use in population models and development of harvest recommendations.

AB  - The aim of our work is to predict potentially optimal areas for red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa hunting success in Andalusia (southern Spain) according to topographic, climatic and vegetation factors and their interaction. We analysed 32,134 annual hunting reports from the period 1993-2001 reported by 6,049 game estates to estimate the average hunting yields of red-legged partridge in each Andalusian municipality (N = 771). We modelled the favourability for obtaining good hunting yields using generalised linear models (GLM) on a set of climatic, topographic, land use and vegetation variables. The variables that affected hunting yields of red-legged partridge were dry herbaceous and wood crops, annual number of frost days, altitude and mean annual temperature. Vegetation was the most important factor of those considered in our study explaining the distribution of good hunting yields of the red-legged partridge in Andalusia. The favourability equation was used to create a downscaled image representing the favourability of obtaining good hunting yields for the red-legged partridge in 1 x 1-km squares in Andalusia, using the ldrisi Image Calculator. Downscaling the model from municipalities to 1 x 1-km squares provided a much higher spatial resolution when predicting the optimal areas for good hunting yields for the red-legged partridge.

AB  - Data on the behavior of walk-hunters and pointing dogs aids in understanding and managing quail harvest. We collected Global Positioning System track logs and recorded behaviors of hunters and. dogs on-northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) hunts in Oklahoma (n = 43), Texas (n = 43), and Missouri (n = 7), USA, during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 hunting seasons. Hunter velocity averaged 0.8 +/- 0.03 (SE) m/second both seasons (n = 85) and pooled(95% CL overlap) velocity of bird dogs was 2.5 +/- 0.07(SE) m/second (n = 154). Hunters spent 60.5 +/- 2.4% (SE) of their time walking in 2005-2006 (n = 45) versus 75.2 +/- 3.5% (SE) in 2006-2007 (n = 48); respective figures for ranging by dogs were 50.2 +/- 2.2% (n = 57) versus 82.0 +/- 1.3% (SE; n = 97). Mean duration of a hunt declined from 82.3 +/- 8.16 (SE) minutes (n = 45) to 50.2 +/- 5.1 (SE) minutes (n = 48) between seasons. Variation in bobwhite abundance was the primary cause of seasonal variation in hunter and dog behaviors because covey-associated activities declined as quail abundance declined. With our results and those of previous workers, managers have first-generation estimates of all variables in hunter-covey interface models for managing bobwhite harvest on discrete areas.

AB  - To improve understanding and mfganagement of the consequences of current rapid environmental change, ecologists advocate using long-term monitoring data series to generate iterative near-term predictions of ecosystem responses. This approach allows scientific evidence to increase rapidly and management strategies to be tailored simultaneously. Iterative near-term forecasting may therefore be particularly useful for adaptive monitoring of ecosystems subjected to rapid climate change. Here, we show how to implement near-term forecasting in the case of a harvested population of rock ptarmigan in high-arctic Svalbard, a region subjected to the largest and most rapid climate change on Earth. We fitted state-space models to ptarmigan counts from point transect distance sampling during 2005-2019 and developed two types of predictions: (1) explanatory predictions to quantify the effect of potential drivers of ptarmigan population dynamics, and (2) anticipatory predictions to assess the ability of candidate models of increasing complexity to forecast next-year population density. Based on the explanatory predictions, we found that a recent increasing trend in the Svalbard rock ptarmigan population can be attributed to major changes in winter climate. Currently, a strong positive effect of increasing average winter temperature on ptarmigan population growth outweighs the negative impacts of other manifestations of climate change such as rain-on-snow events. Moreover, the ptarmigan population may compensate for current harvest levels. Based on the anticipatory predictions, the near-term forecasting ability of the models improved nonlinearly with the length of the time series, but yielded good forecasts even based on a short time series. The inclusion of ecological predictors improved forecasts of sharp changes in next-year population density, demonstrating the value of ecosystem-based monitoring. Overall, our study illustrates the power of integrating near-term forecasting in monitoring systems to aid understanding and management of wildlife populations exposed to rapid climate change. We provide recommendations for how to improve this approach.

AB  - We studied the helminth community and body condition of 99 hunter-harvested red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) from Ciudad Real (Central Spain). Forty-six were sampled in two game estates where an important number of farm-reared red-legged partridges are released yearly. The remaining 53 were obtained from natural wild populations adjacent to one of the estates with releases. Four nematode species (Heterakis gallinarum, Aonchoteca caudinflata, Eucoleus contortus and Cheilospirura gruveli) and two cestode species (Raillietina (R.) tetragona and Skryabinia bolivari) were identified. The managed areas showed higher parasite diversity, with higher prevalences and intensities for all helminths found. Three of these species were typical of farm-bred partridges and two of these, A. caundinflata and S. bolivari, were found parasitizing adult partridges. This suggests introduction of these helminths into the breeding population of managed states. The birds sampled in the nonmanaged estates showed a better body condition, but no relation with parasite infection was found. Our results suggest that the release of farm-reared red-legged partridges, a strategy that is becoming a common practice in Spanish hunting areas, poses risk to wild populations because of introducing parasites. However, these results also suggest that simply stopping releases may be a good way to remove locally those parasites from populations, as the establishment of the introduced parasites seems limited.

AB  - We studied the habitat relationships of male ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) at the landscape scale when grouse were at the peak of their population cycle. We located 290 and 230 male grouse during 2009 and 2010, respectively, on 30 landscapes encompassing 5,349ha. We used an information-theoretic model selection approach to examine 2 sets of a priori models. We designed our first model set to evaluate the relationships between Shannon's evenness index of cover types and grouse density and our second set to evaluate other relationships between grouse density and landscape configuration. The top model in the first set was a null model (intercepts only), but a competing model indicated that Shannon's evenness index was positively correlated with male grouse density (r=0.43). Shannon's evenness index was confounded with cover type dominance in landscapes because it was positively correlated (r=0.55) with the proportion of the aspen cover type and negatively correlated (r=-0.79) with the proportion of the conifer cover type. The top-ranked model from our second model set included only year and road density. Road density was negatively related to grouse density (r=-0.34), which could mean either hunting pressure along roads affected density or cover types were different in landscapes with greater road densities. The year-only model indicated that male grouse density was less in 2010 than in 2009 ((year)=-0.014, 95% CI=-0.024 to -0.005). We predict that forest management practices that result in an even distribution of cover types within landscapes should result in greater densities of grouse. (c) 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Setting dates of spring hunting for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) gobblers often is based on the belief that 2 peaks of gobbling occur, with the second peak occurring during peak incubation by hens. The second peak offers hunters opportunities to hear gobblers while protecting hens from inadvertent kill. We examined chronology of gabbling, hunter numbers, harvest and nesting within the framework of a long, liberal spring gobbler-only hunting season in central Mississippi during 1984-95. Distribution of gobbler harvest versus initiation of incubation, and hunter numbers versus incubation initiation differed in all veers; distribution of gobblers heard versus initiation of incubation differed during all years except 1995. Distributional relations among hunter numbers, harvest, and gobblers heard varied among years. Gobblers heard versus harvest, and hunter numbers versus harvest were distributed differently during some years. Only 1 gobbling peak occurred. This lone peak of gobbling was not associated with peak of incubation. Gobbling activity may have been influenced by break up of winter flocks, initiation of egg-laying, and mating opportunities.

AB  - The release of farm-reared game is considered a conflictive management tool because of its potential harmful ecological effects on wildlife and associated habitats. Estimates of the number of animals released and the area where this game management takes place could give an idea of the magnitude of their potential impacts. We aimed to quantitatively assess the release of farm-reared red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) in the province of Ciudad Real, central Spain, one of the main hunting areas in this country. We analysed the official permits that the regional government granted to the hunting estates to release farm-reared partridges between 2006 and 2012. Our results show that an average of 800,000 partridges were released annually in the study area. A decrease in the number of hunting estates that used this game management practice, as well as in the number of red-legged partridges officially released, was observed during the last years within the study period. This might be a consequence of the current economic crisis, rather than a change in management styles. Release intensity was spatially heterogeneous, being higher in the southeast of the study area, where historically red-legged partridge was more abundant. Most of the red-legged partridges released came from only four farms placed in northern Spain. Our results suggest that this management activity should be better monitored and that spatial regulations should also be considered.

AB  - Wildlife monitoring performed by volunteer personnel may suffer from bias with regard to their habitat use. Such errors can lead to erroneous population estimates, evidently influencing both management programmes and research that are based on the monitoring. We used a dataset on hunters' habitat use in forest while searching for black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) to test whether hunters' utilisation of the habitat was independent of that of grouse or if it corresponded to the grouse habitat preference. Twenty volunteer hunters with dogs registered their tracks and all observations of capercaillie and black grouse in stfold County, Norway, during August 2003 and 2004. We performed an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) and a K-select analysis with respect to hunters' selection for habitat, described with ecogeographical variables related to forest stand characteristics, as well as the habitat preference of the observed grouse, conditional on the habitat utilisation of the hunters. Individual ENFA on the hunter's tracks revealed large variation in the habitat preferences of the hunters. The K-select indicated few overall patterns in the habitat characteristics of grouse observations, conditional on the hunters selected habitat. Accordingly, the results indicate that hunters' observation of grouse prior to the hunt may give indicators of changes in grouse density unbiased by habitat preference due to the large between-hunter variation in habitat preference, given that a sufficient number of hunters is used. This suggests that such monitoring programmes can provide information about fluctuations in grouse population sizes valuable for both the management and research of forest grouse species.

AB  - The decline of over-hunted red-legged (Alectoris rufa) and rock (A. graeca) partridge populations has been contrasted with massive releases of captive-reared birds, often hybrids with non-indigenous A. chukar. Released interspecific hybrids raise the risks of introgressive hybridisation, and can contribute to further depress the fitness of native populations. Aiming to assess the extent of hybridisation, we genotyped the mtDNA control-region and eight nuclear microsatellites in 671 red-legged, rock and chukar partridges and hybrids, identified by phenotypic traits. Results reveal a diffuse occurrence of hybridisation: (1) 39 samples (6.2%) show mtDNA haplotypes discordant with their phenotypes, indicating red-legged and chukar mtDNA introgression in native rock partridges; (2) admixture analyses of the microsatellite genotypes identified 32 additional rock partridges (5.1%) hybridised mainly with chukars. We analysed also 39 samples collected from a presumed natural red-legged x rock partridge hybrid zone in the French Alps. Surprisingly, 28% birds showed typical chukar mtDNAs, indicating hybridisation with introduced chukars or hybrids. This hybrid zone led to an introgression cline of chukar alleles into neighbouring Alpine rock partridges detectable up to 100 km, which was shorter than expected by neutral genetic theory, and that suggested natural selection against hybrids. These findings indicate that introgressive hybridisation may disrupt local adaptations in natural red-legged partridge and rock partridge populations, and call for strict control of farming and restocking operations.

AB  - Scientific management of quail harvest at the state level must be based on a clear understanding of the effects of hunting regulations on hunters and populations. Therefore, we assessed how reduction in bag limits would affect hunter opportunity and harvest rates of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in Oklahoma, USA, using harvest data from questionnaire surveys. Reductions in bag limits were regressive because reductions had relatively less effect on hunting opportunity and harvest rate at low populations than at high populations. Based on data primarily from Oklahoma and Missouri, we found that the negative binomial distribution described the probability of an integer bag (0, 1, 2, 3,... birds) if the mean and variance of daily bag were known. The negative binomial distribution provides a general method of assessing the effects of bag-limit reduction on hunting opportunity and harvest rates. The skill of the average hunter apparently declined as the statewide bobwhite population increased. Although hunting was self-regulatory in that the number of hunters declined as the bobwhite population declined, it was not self-regulatory when adjusted for the relative skill of hunters at low and high populations. We argue that fixed, relatively low bag limits established as a risk-aversive strategy for low populations of bobwhites may not necessarily have large impact on hunting opportunity with high populations.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that hunter effort varies temporally and spatially, affecting game populations in unexpected ways. We set out to identify sources of variation in the spatial distribution of hunter effort by ring-necked pheasant Phasianus colchicus hunters during two time periods representing different spatial decisions: where to access a hunting location at the start of a hunt and where to hunt within it for the duration of the hunt. Pheasant hunters used direct and indirect information about the availability and accessibility of pheasants to make spatial decisions throughout their hunts, but the sources of information used at the beginning of hunts differed from those used for the duration of hunts. Hunter access point effort at the start of hunts was positively associated with proximity to public access signs and declined near marked safety zones around occupied structures and livestock, indicating that hunters responded to the spatial distribution and information content of public access infrastructure. Hunter effort within fields for the duration of hunts was positively related to predicted pheasant habitat use and negatively associated with correlates of physical exertion and increasing distance from field edges. Our findings indicate that hunters in the field are making spatial decisions in response to information about public land access, their own physical state, and perceived opportunity to encounter pheasants. Our results further suggest managers may be able to optimize public lands for wildlife habitat and recreational value without imposing new regulations by managing the information provided to hunters.

AB  - Synchrony is an important component of wildlife population dynamics because it describes spatial pattern in temporal population fluctuations. The strength and spatial extent of synchrony can provide information about the extrinsic and intrinsic forces that shape population structure. Wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) populations undergo annual fluctuations, possibly due to variation in weather during the reproductive season. To determine if spring weather plays a role in synchronizing wild turkey populations, we used a modified Mantel-type spatial autocorrelation procedure to measure the synchrony in fall wild turkey harvest data collected in 443 townships from 1990 to 1995 and compared this to the pattern of synchrony in spring weather variables (May rainfall and temp) over the same period. We measured correlation using Spearman correlation coefficients between the total fall harvests from 1990 to 1995 for each pair of townships, and sorted pairs into 6 50-km distance intervals. We calculated a mean correlation coefficient for each interval and estimated its P-value using resampling. We found moderately significant synchrony in the fall harvest (r(s) = 0.12-0.34 P < 0.008) among township pairs <150 km apart, but no significant synchrony beyond this distance. In contrast, both May temperature (r = 0.82-0.90, P < 0.001) and rainfall (r = 0.49-0.76, P < 0.001) were strongly synchronized across all 6 distance intervals. Visual inspection of time series in the wild turkey fall harvest suggests that populations may be synchronized in some years when weather promotes high reproductive success (i.e., a synchronized growth peak) and asynchronous in other years. Knowledge of the spatial dynamics of wild turkey populations will aid wildlife managers in estimating population change, setting harvest quotas, and managing habitat.

AB  - Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) adult hen and juvenile survival have been shown to have significant influence on population growth rates. However, assessing the sensitivity of population growth rates to variability in juvenile survival has proven difficult because of limited information concerning the potentially important demographic rate. Sage-grouse survival rates are commonly assessed using necklace-type radio transmitters. Recent technological advances have lead to increased interest in the deployment of dorsally mounted global positioning system (GPS) transmitters for studying sage-grouse ecology. However, the use of dorsally mounted transmitters has not been thoroughly evaluated for sage-grouse, leading to concern that birds fitted with these transmitters may experience differential mortality rates. We evaluated the effect of transmitter positioning (dorsal vs. necklace) on juvenile sage-grouse survival using a controlled experimental design with necklace-style and suture-backpack very high frequency (VHF) transmitters. To evaluate the effects of temporal variation, sex, and transmitter type on juvenile sage-grouse survival, we monitored 91 juveniles captured in south-central Utah from 2008 to 2010. We instrumented 19 females with backpacks, 14 males with backpacks, 39 females with necklaces, and 19 males with necklaces. We used Program MARK to analyze juvenile survival data. Although effects were only marginally significant from a statistical perspective, sex (P=0.103) and transmitter type (P=0.09) were deemed to have biologically meaningful impacts on survival. Dorsally mounted transmitters appeared to negatively affected daily survival (transmitter type=-0.55, SE=0.32). Temporal variation in juvenile sage-grouse daily survival was best described by a quadratic trend in time, where daily survival was lowest in late September and was high overwinter. An interaction between the quadratic trend in time and year resulted in the low point of daily survival shifting within the season between years (27 vs. 17 Sep for 2008 and 2009, respectively). Overall (15 Aug-31 Mar) derived survival ranged 0.42-0.62 for females and 0.23-0.44 for males. For all years pooled, the probability death was due to predation was 0.73, reported harvest was 0.16, unreported harvest was 0.09, and other undetermined factors was 0.02. We observed 0% and 6.8% crippling loss (from hunting) in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We recommend the adoption of harvest management strategies that attempt to shift harvest away from juveniles and incorporate crippling rates. In addition, future survival studies on juvenile sage-grouse should use caution if implementing dorsally mounted transmitters because of the potential for experimental bias.

AB  - The ecological relationship between the polymorphic Asiatic golden cat ( Catopuma temminckii) ) and terrestrial pheasants, apparently threatened due to habitat degradation and hunting in Bhutan's Phrumsengla National Park, has never been studied yet. This research, which assessed the occupancy and activity pattern of 5 polymorphic Asiatic golden cats and 4 terrestrial pheasants such as blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), Himalayan monal ( Lophophorus impejanus), ), satyr tragopan ( Tragopan satyra), ), and kalij pheasant ( Lophura leucomelanos) ) to determine their predator-prey relationship, has the potential to significantly impact conservation strategies. The images of 5 polymorphic Asiatic golden cats (n= 158) and 4 species of terrestrial pheasants (n=242) captured by infrared digital camera traps (n=24) from October 29(th), 2015, to March 13th, 2016, were analyzed using the CameraSweet programs. Our study revealed negligible predator-prey correlation in the occupancy of polymorphic felids and pheasants despite co-occurring across broadleaf through subalpine forests. On the contrary, the Chi-square test inferred a significant predator-prey relationship in the paired activity patterns of tightly-rosette (first ever recorded for Bhutan in 2015), golden and gray morphs with blood pheasant, thus suggesting it as a potential prey base. Feral dogs that appeared to form predator guild must be decimated to reduce food competition with Asiatic golden cats and prevent the potential risk of transmitting canine distemper and rabies. We recommend reviewing the protection status of pheasants and Asiatic golden cats and delving into the diet composition of polymorphic cats to gain critical insights into formulating an effective conservation strategy amid growing anthropogenic pressure in Phrumsengla National Park.

AB  - Previous investigations using continuous video monitoring of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus nests have unambiguously identified common ravens Corvus corax as an important egg predator within the western United States. The quantity of greater sage-grouse eggs an individual common raven consumes during the nesting period and the extent to which common ravens actively hunt greater sage-grouse nests are largely unknown. However, some evidence suggests that territorial breeding common ravens, rather than nonbreeding transients, are most likely responsible for nest depredations. We describe greater sage-grouse egg depredation observations obtained opportunistically from three common raven nests located in Idaho and Nevada where depredated greater sage-grouse eggs were found at or in the immediate vicinity of the nest site, including the caching of eggs in nearby rock crevices. We opportunistically monitored these nests by counting and removing depredated eggs and shell fragments from the nest sites during each visit to determine the extent to which the common raven pairs preyed on greater sage-grouse eggs. To our knowledge, our observations represent the first evidence that breeding, territorial pairs of common ravens cache greater sage-grouse eggs and are capable of depredating multiple greater sage-grouse nests.

AB  - Hunters' estimates of pair densities of the grey partridge Perdix perdix as derived from an annual questionnaire survey ('Game Survey Lower Saxony', WTE) were evaluated by comparison with detailed ground-truthing censuses in 123 randomly chosen hunting districts representing 63,847 ha potential grey partridge habitat. Estimates and evaluation-census-densities were highly significantly correlated. The median of the hunters' estimate errors, disregarding the direction of the relative discrepancy, was 24.2%. Hunters underestimated the density per 100 ha potential habitat by 0.16 breeding pairs on average. The discrepancy increased with higher grey partridge densities and increasing size of the hunting district. The satisfactory agreement between the estimates of the hunters, in most cases local farmers, and the evaluation survey is explained by their comprehensive year-round presence through their hunting, farming but also their leisure activities and their special interest in this charismatic bird combined with its site fidelity. We recommend the consultation of WTE data as a valuable source of basic information on distribution and abundance of grey partridges to identify spatial conservation priorities, to justify conservation initiatives and to adapt management practices.

AB  - The Chukar Partridge (Alectoris chukar, Galliformes) is one of the most important game birds in its native range, spanning from the Balkans to eastern Asia, and the regions of Europe, North America and New Zealand where it was introduced. Previous studies found two main genetic lineages of the species forming an eastern and a western clade. Chukar Partridges are raised in game farms and released to supplement natural populations for shooting in the USA, Canada, Greece, and Turkey. To explore intraspecific genetic structure, phylogeography, and possible genetic admixture events of A. chukar in Turkey, we genotyped individuals from fourteen wild and five captive populations at two mitochondrial and ten microsatellite DNA loci in. Wild and farmed Chukar Partridge samples were analyzed together to investigate possible influences of intraspecific hybridizations. We found that the farmed chukars, which mainly (85%) cluster into the eastern clade, and wild ones were genetically distinct. The latter could be separated into six management units (MUs), with partridges from Gokceada Island in the Aegean Sea forming the most divergent population. Intraspecific hybridization was detected between wild and captive populations. This phenomenon causes rampant introgression and homogenization. The phylogeographic analysis revealed admixture among wild populations; nevertheless, this did not impair pointing to Anatolia as likely having a "refugia-within-refugia" structure. We recommend that the genetic structure of Chukar Partridge and its MUs be taken into account when developing the policy of hunting, production, and release to preserve the genetic integrity of this species.

AB  - 1. Hen harriers Circus cyaneus prey on red grouse Lagopus l. scoticus and high breeding densities of harriers can limit the number of grouse available for shooting in the autumn. Ultimately, grouse hunting contributes to the maintenance of heather moorland, an ecologically important habitat for biodiversity in general and hen harriers in particular. Predation rates vary widely among harrier individuals. Understanding which factors influence this variation would be useful to target management to mitigate the effect of harriers on grouse, such as diversionary feeding.        2. We used a simple habitat-based approach to test whether we could identify harrier nests to which most grouse were delivered. Using remote sensing habitat data, we tested whether delivery rates of dead grouse to the nest by hen harriers were higher for those pairs nesting in sites with more heather Calluna vulgaris. A relationship between heather cover and grouse delivery rates might have been expected as grouse densities were correlated with heather cover.        3. After adjusting for annual variation in grouse abundance, the rate at which grouse were delivered to harrier nests was positively associated with the proportion of heather cover within 2 km of harrier nests. This was primarily due to the positive effect of heather cover on female delivery rates.        4. This result allowed us to use habitat data to predict the harrier nests to which most grouse chicks would be delivered. Comparison of predictions of the model with observations of food delivery to nests indicated that, in terms of grouse chick delivery, the model correctly predicted the top 50% of harrier nests in five of six years.        5. We undertook an experiment where carrion was provided to certain harriers at nest sites, in order to decrease their predation on grouse. Data from this experiment showed that when harriers were given diversionary food, the relationship between grouse predation rate and habitat was removed, with grouse predation reduced to negligible levels in most cases. This demonstrated the increased benefit of feeding birds with the highest proportion of heather cover within 2 km of their nest sites, rather than feeding birds at random within the conflict population.        6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of heather cover around hen harrier nests can be used to predict which pairs will predate most grouse within a population. This information should facilitate targeted management practices, which may accrue greater benefit for grouse stocks and potentially reduce the conflict between grouse shooting and conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Models are important tools that can help managers and researchers understand the population dynamics of a species and how different habitat or population management scenarios impact that species. We used radio-telemetry data from northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in southern Texas from 2000 to 2005 to develop a stochastic simulation model for bobwhite populations. Our model is based on difference equations, with stochastic variables drawn from normal and Weibull distributions. We simulated bobwhite populations to 100 yr and evaluated our model by comparing results with independent estimates of 4 population parameters (spring and fall density, finite rate of increase in the fall population [lambda], and winter juv:ad age ratios). Using a quasi-extinction criterion of <= 40 birds (density <= 0.05 birds/ha), probability of persistence to 100 yr was 88.3% (106 of 120 simulations) for the spring population and 96.7% (116 of 120 simulations) for the fall population. Using a less restrictive quasi-extinction criteria (<= 14 birds), probability of persistence was 93.3% (112 of 120 simulations) for the spring population and 98.3% (118 of 120 simulations) for the fall population. Simulated population parameters were similar to independent estimates for 4 of 4 population parameters. Winter age ratios differed between our model ((x) over bar = 4.98 juv:ad, n = 120, SE = 0.32) and empirical age ratios from harvested bobwhites on our study area ((x) over bar = 2.85 juv:ad, n = 25, SE = 0.24). However, when we corrected harvest age ratios for bias in juvenile harvest ((x) over bar = 3.85 juv:ad, n = 25, SE = 0.32) simulated and empirical estimates were similar. Our model appears to be a reliable predictor of bobwhite populations in the southern Texas. Our simulation results indicate that bobwhite hunters and managers can expect excellent bobwhite hunting (fall populations >= 2.2 birds per ha) in about one of 10 yr. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Declines in bird populations in agricultural regions of North America and Europe have been attributed to agricultural industrialization, increases in use of agrochemical application, and increased predation related to habitat modification. Based on count data compiled from Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 1974 to 2012, Christmas Bird Count (CBC) collected from 1914 to 2013, and hunter data from Annual Game Take Survey (AGTS) for years 1948-2010, ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in California have experienced substantial declines in agricultural environments. Using a modeling approach that integrates all three forms of survey data into a joint response abundance index, we found pheasant abundance was related to the amount of harvested and unharvested crop land, types of crops produced, amount of total pesticide applied, minimum temperature, precipitation, and numbers of avian competitors and predators. Specifically, major changes in agricultural practices over the last three decades were associated with declines in pheasant numbers and likely reflected widespread loss of habitat. For example, increases in cropland were associated with increased pheasant abundance during early years of study but this effect decreased through time, such that no association in recent years was evidenced. A post hoc analysis revealed that crops beneficial to pheasant abundance (e.g., barley) have declined substantially in recent decades and were replaced by less advantageous crops (e.g., nut trees). An additional analysis using a restricted data set (1990-2013) indicated recent negative impacts on pheasant numbers associated with land use practices were also associated with relatively high levels of pesticide application. Our results may provide valuable information for management policies aimed at reducing widespread declines in pheasant populations in California and may be applicable to other avian species within agricultural settings. Furthermore, this general analytical approach is not limited to pheasants and could be applied to other taxa for which multiple survey data sources exist.

AB  - Currently available methods of estimating northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance are often expensive and time-consuming; therefore, additional research is necessary to develop new tools. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System technologies and distance-sampling theory, we developed a method of estimating bobwhite density during hunts with pointing dogs. Data collection occurred during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 hunting seasons in western Oklahoma and northern Texas, USA. We estimated effective strip width (ESW) of a bird dog's path using distance-sampling theory and point-to-flush distances. For coveys > 7 birds (n = 58), estimated ESW was 13.2 m (95% CI = 11.1-15.6 m). Area searched by one dog was its GPS path buffered by ESW. For > 2 dogs, area searched was the union of the areas of individual dogs; taking the union eliminated between- or among-dog redundancy in searched areas. A point estimate of density was number of birds flushed on a hunt divided by searched area. During the 2005-2006 hunting season, bobwhite density averaged 1.4 birds/ha (+/- 0.28 SE; n = 33). Average density declined to 0.2 birds/ha (+/- 0.07 SE) during 2006-2007 (n = 46). Estimating bobwhite density with pointing dogs needs further testing and development, but the technique may prove useful in research and management.

KW  - BREEDING SUCCESS
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - The impact of predator removal or protection on the reproductive success and density of grouse populations was studied experimentally in southern and northern Finland. In predator removal areas small and medium-sized carnivores were efficiently hunted, while in predator protection areas hunting was prohibited. Both predator (red fox, raccoon dog, pine marten and stoat) and grouse populations were monitored. The breeding success of grouse, indicated by the young/adults ratio, decreased in the predator protection area in northern Finland during a vole low. Despite a decline in the vole population, the breeding success of grouse did not decline in the predator removal area. The mean brood size during the experiment was significantly higher in the removal areas than in the protection areas both in southern and northern Finland. Predator removal/protection thus affected the reproductive success of grouse, but the impact of control on adult grouse populations was not as evident.

AB  - Meat yield, proximate composition, pH and drip loss of breast and thigh muscles were studied in 29 hunted male and 32 slaughtered female pheasants. In the breast muscles of additional 14 hunted male pheasants, colour, cooking loss and shear force were measured. Weight of muscles of hunted male pheasants was higher than that of slaughtered females, but the percentages of breast and thigh muscles relative to the dressed carcass did not differ. Average protein concentrations in lean muscles were above 22%, and average fat was below 1.2%. In breast muscles, pH(24) was lower than in thigh (ca. 5.6 vs. 6.0), and, consequently, drip loss was higher (2.2-3.0% vs. 1.0-1.5%). Colour of breast muscles was characterised by L*a*b* values of about 55, 4 and 8-9, respectively. The shear force of breast muscles was about 30 N/cm(2).

AB  - Although previous research and theory has suggested that wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations may be subject to some form of density dependence, there has been no effort to estimate and incorporate a density-dependence parameter into wild turkey population models. To estimate a functional relationship for density dependence in wild turkey, we analyzed a set of harvest-index time series from 11 state wildlife agencies. We tested for lagged correlations between annual harvest indices using partial autocorrelation analysis. We assessed the ability of the density-dependent theta-Ricker model to explain harvest indices over time relative to exponential or random walk growth models. We tested the homogeneity of the density-dependence parameter estimates (0) from 3 different harvest indices (spring harvest no. reported harvest/effort, survey harvest/effort) and calculated a weighted average based on each estimate's variance and its estimated covariance with the other indices. To estimate the potential bias in parameter estimates from measurement error, we conducted a simulation study using the theta-Ricker with known values and lognormally distributed measurement error. Partial autocorrelation function analysis indicated that harvest indices were significantly correlated only with their value at the previous time step. The theta-Ricker model performed better than the exponential growth or random walk models for all 3 indices. Simulation of known parameters and measurement error indicated a strong positive upward bias in the density-dependent parameter estimate, with increasing measurement error. The average density-dependence estimate, corrected for measurement error ranged 0.25 <= (theta) over cap <= 0.49, depending on the amount of measurement error and assumed spring harvest rate. We infer that density dependence is nonlinear in wild turkey, where growth rates are maximized at 39-42% of carrying capacity. The annual yield produced by density-dependent population growth will tend to be less than that caused by extrinsic environmental factors. This study indicates that both density-dependent and density-independent processes are important to wild turkey population growth, and we make initial suggestions on incorporating both into harvest management strategies.

AB  - Scientists have been predicting the extinction of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) since 1916, and sage-grouse populations have declined relentlessly during the last century despite attempts to reverse the decline. In this review paper, we examined the scientific literature to evaluate hypotheses about why sage-grouse populations have declined. There is little support for the hypotheses that the decline is due to overhunting, parasites, food shortages, or collisions with power lines or fences. West Nile Virus (WNV) reduced sage grouse up to 25% when the virus first reached the West during 2002, but sage-grouse have developed resistance to the virus since then, rendering the virus less virulent. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), great horned owls (Bufo virginianus), and coyotes (Canis latrans) kill many adult sage-grouse, but populations of these predators have not increased during the last century, so predation by these predators probably have not contributed to the decline. In contrast, common ravens (Corvus corax) have become more numerous in the West, and nesting success of sage-grouse is higher in areas where raven numbers are low or have decreased. Sage-grouse broods often forage in wet meadows that are interspersed among the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), but many of these wet areas have converted into pastures and alfalfa fields. Local populations of sage-grouse have collapsed when sagebrush habitat is eliminated due to fire, development, or conversion to pasture or farmland. Areas where sage grouse have been extirpated are along the periphery of the sage-grouse's range, have more people, have less sagebrush, and have lost much of the sagebrush that once existed there. Hence, the decline of sage-grouse populations can be attributed, at least in part, to the loss of large stands of sagebrush, but just why large stands are important is unclear.

AB  - We documented the fates of 1,104 ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) nests in harvested and unharvested hayfields near Sibley, Illinois, [USA] from 1962 to 1972. A mean of 13 and 35% of nests in harvested and unharvested hay, respectively, hatched. Mortality rates of females and embryos were high when hay cutting coincided with the late stages of incubation. Dates when forage crops in the Midwest are harvested have gradually advanced since World War II, especially in the northern  portions of the pheasant range where dairy and livestock production are prevalent. Over the past decade, the mean day of first cutting for alfalfa, the most widely planted hay cultivar in the Midwest, has been 3 June, about 10 days earlier than it was during the 1950''s. Mortality rates for pheasant nests found after the first cutting of hay near Sibley, Illinois, were used with mean dates of the first hay cutting for Illinois to compute indices of female and nest destruction for 1951-58 and  1977-87. Indices of pheasant destruction were lower (P < 0.01) for 1977-87, which suggests that mortality of embryos and females during haying operations is, on average, easing in the Midwest due to earlier cutting. The presence of small tracts of nest cover near hayfields, if carefully managed, could enhance pheasant reproduction.

AB  - The northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is an ecologically and economically valuable species in the United States. Managers rely on autumn density estimates to set harvest regulations, balancing the interests of hunters and long-term bobwhite population viability. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) is a useful framework for estimating population size and modeling spatial variation in density. We used SCR to quantify the effect of landscape structure on spatial variation in density for a population of bobwhites on the Di-Lane Wildlife Management Area in Waynesboro, Georgia, USA. Without additional telemetry or nesting data, we were also able to estimate a spatially explicit metric of productivity. To sample the population, we deployed a fixed array of 395, 262, and 268 funnel traps in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. We estimated age structure, with the highest density of juveniles (0.32 birds/ha, 95% CI = 0.28-0.37) and adults (0.10 birds/ha, 95% CI = 0.08-0.12) estimated in 2016. In our top model, density was negatively related to the proportion of closed canopy hardwoods. To increase bobwhite density on the landscape, managers should reduce the amount of closed canopy hardwood forest. Furthermore, the spatially explicit age ratio we estimated could be used to target management towards increasing the recruitment of chicks into the autumn population. An SCR approach may require additional logistical and financial resources relative to other data collection methods, but it makes modeling spatial variation in density straightforward and can be used to gather data to simultaneously understand population structure, vital rates, and movement.

However, there are no published data on how NWSG managed with livestock in the Mid-Southmay affect habitat for wildlife. We conducted a study to evaluate habitat for grassland songbirds and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in response to two cattle grazing treatments in NWSG pastures across three sites in Tennessee, 2010 and 2011. We evaluated vegetation composition and structure along with invertebrate availability during the primary nesting season for grassland songbirds and the typical brood-rearing season for the northern bobwhite. Grazing treatments included full-season (May to August) grazing and early-season (30 days beginning in May) grazing, after which subsequent growth was taken as a biofuel harvest postdormancy. Forage treatments included big bluestem/indiangrass mixture, switch-grass, and eastern gamagrass. Vegetation composition was dominated by the planted forages in all pastures. All forage types and both grazing treatments provided suitable structure for grassland songbirds and bobwhite during the primary nesting season. Full-season grazing maintained suitable structure through the brooding period, with greater openness at the ground level and angle of obstruction, as well as optimal vegetation height (<60 cm). Structure within early-season grazing treatments became dense after cattle were removed with less openness at ground level than what brooding bobwhites typically use. Invertebrate biomass was sufficient in all forage types and grazing treatments to support bobwhite broods. We recommend livestock producers in the Mid-South use full-season grazing that maintains grass height of approximately 40 cm in production stands of NWSG to maximize benefits for grassland birds and northern bobwhite.

AB  - Anthropogenic hybridization in wildlife has been identified as one of the main causes of genetic homogenization, highlighting the need for identification and evaluation of populations at risk. Relocation of wildlife for game management purposes is a widespread practice that may promote the admixing of genetically different populations, subspecies or species. We undertook a large-scale study on the Iberian Peninsula to assess the extent of hybridization in red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa populations, which have been subject to extensive restocking of farm-reared individuals. Using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique to assess the prevalence of individuals with mtDNA from other species, we examined samples of A. rufa from museum specimens (229), extant wild populations (955) and game farms (530). We found widespread occurrence of chukar partridge Alectoris chukar mtDNA lineages in samples obtained from game farm partridges (63% of game farms) and from wild partridges (45% of populations), but no allochthonous mtDNA lineages were found in museum partridges. We also found that the probability of occurrence and the number of partridges with allochthonous lineages was higher in localities where recent restocking had occurred. In addition, investigation of trends in bag records and the numbers of game farms over the past 30 years suggests that the general decline of wild populations has been accompanied by an increase in game farm facilities. These results suggest that supplemental stocking practices are threatening the integrity of the wild population gene pool. We recommend that rural development policies and associated wildlife management programs focused on maintaining high stock densities for hunting also need to consider the impact of game management on the genetic integrity of game populations.

AB  - Ten state wildlife management agencies in the United States, including six within the Southeast, have delayed their spring wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) hunting seasons since 2017 by five or more days to address concerns related to the potential effects of hunting on wild turkey seasonal productivity. One hypothesis posits that if the spring hunting season is too early, there may be insufficient time for males to breed hens before being harvested, thus leading to reduced seasonal productivity. We conducted an experiment to determine whether delaying the wild turkey hunting season by 2 weeks in south-middle Tennessee would affect various reproductive rates. In 2021 and 2022, the Tennessee Fish and Wildlife Commission experimentally delayed the spring hunting season to open 14 days later than the traditional date (the Saturday closest to 1 April) in Giles, Lawrence, and Wayne counties. We monitored reproductive rates from 2017 to 2022 in these three counties as well as two adjacent counties, Bedford and Maury, that were not delayed. We used a Before-After-Control-Impact design to analyze the proportion of hens nesting, clutch size, hatchability, nest success, poult survival and hen survival with linear mixed-effect models and AIC model selection to detect relationships between the 14-day delay and reproductive parameters. We detected no relationship (p > .05) between the 14-day delay and any individual reproductive parameter. In addition, recruitment (hen poults per hen that survived until the next breeding season) was very low (<0.5) and did not increase because of the 14-day delay. The traditional Tennessee start date had been in place since 1986 while the turkey harvest increased markedly until about 2006 and more recently stabilized. Our data indicate that moving the start of the hunting season from a period just prior to peak nest initiation to 2 weeks later, to coincide with a period just prior to peak nest incubation initiation, resulted in no change to productivity or populations in wild turkey flocks in south-middle Tennessee.

AB  - During October 1998 - May 1999, we studied the distribution of hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia and the structure of their habitats in southern Korea. Hazel grouse were censused from the responses to calls imitated using a Scandinavian metal hunter's whistle in winter and spring along line transects. Hazel grouse were distributed in most of the high mountain forest areas in southern Korea. The frequency of occurrence varied with altitude within the range of 300-1,200 m a.s.l., with the highest density at 600-900 in a.s.l. Altitudinal distribution differed between seasons, however, and hazel grouse were observed at lower altitudes more often in winter than in spring. They occurred in mixed, deciduous and coniferous forest areas, but the use of forest types varied by season. Particularly many individuals were observed in planted Japanese larch Larix leptolepis forests. The coverage and density of understory vegetation was more developed where hazel grouse were observed, but coverage more than 2 in above ground did not seem to be important in explaining hazel grouse presence. The occurrence of hazel grouse was related to the development of understory vegetation more than to forest type. Seasonal use of forest types may have been related to the combined availability of food and cover in understory vegetation.

AB  - Conservation practitioners often rely on areas designed to protect species of greatest conservation priority to also conserve co-occurring species (i.e., the umbrella species concept). The extent to which vertebrate species may serve as suitable umbrellas for invertebrate species, however, has rarely been explored. Sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.) have high conservation priority throughout much of the rangelands of western North America and are considered an umbrella species through which the conservation of entire rangeland ecosystems can be accomplished. Harvester ants are ecosystem engineers and play important roles in the maintenance and function of rangeland ecosystems. We compared indices of the abundance of western harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) and Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) at 72 sites in central Wyoming, USA, in 2012. The abundance of harvester ant mounds was best predicted by a regression model that included a combination of local habitat characteristics and the abundance of sage-grouse. When controlling for habitat-related factors, areas with higher abundances of sage-grouse pellets (an index of sage-grouse abundance and/or habitat use) had higher abundances of ant mounds than areas with lower abundances of sage-grouse pellets. The causal mechanism underlying this positive relationship between sage-grouse and ant mound abundance at the fine scale could be indirect (e.g., both species prefer similar environmental conditions) or direct (e.g., sage-grouse prefer areas with a high abundance of ant mounds because ants are an important prey item during certain life stages). We observed no relationship between a broad-scale index of breeding sage-grouse density and the abundance of ant mounds. We suspect that consideration of the nonbreeding habitat of sage-grouse and finer-scale measures of sagegrouse abundance are critical to the utility of sage-grouse as an umbrella species for the conservation of harvester ants and their important role in rangeland ecosystems.

AB  - Anticipating and mitigating the effects climate change will have on wildlife populations requires an improved understanding of the ways in which those populations are currently adapted to climate and how they are affected by variation in weather conditions. We used over 70,000 greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) wings, derived from hunter harvest in three western states, to characterize spatiotemporal variation in sage-grouse productivity throughout the North American Great Basin during 1993 - 2020. We then tested the hypothesis that previously-identified associations between precipitation and sage-grouse productivity are mediated by the availability of mesic habitats, which provide the diet resources required by broods during typical late-summer seasonal drought. We used random forest regression to model sage-grouse productivity as a function of mesic habitat availability (defined as those areas with maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) >= 0.3) during the late brood-rearing period, the more general effect of annual precipitation, and landcover composition. We also evaluated potential acute direct effects of exposure to inclement weather on sage-grouse productivity. Finally, we examined which weather and topographic variables best predict mesic habitat availability. We found the predicted positive relationship between mesic habitat availability and sage-grouse productivity, but annual precipitation explained additional variation in productivity even after accounting for mesic habitat availability. Hence, precipitation and drought may drive sage-grouse productivity via more than one mechanism acting on multiple demographic rates. Productivity was also limited by exotic annual grass invasion and conifer encroachment. Mesic habitat availability was a function of topographic relief, mean elevation, annual mean snow water equivalent, and winter temperatures, indicating that snowpack recharges the late summer mesic resources that support sage-grouse productivity. Management actions focused on maintaining and restoring mesic re-sources and drought resilient habitats, limiting the spread of exotic annual grasses, and reversing conifer encroachment should support future sage-grouse recruitment and help mitigate the effects of climate change.

AB  - Productivity (offspring production) is a key demographic parameter influencing population dynamics, particularly in r-strategy species, and thus critical for implementing well-based management of populations. Accordingly, the study of factors influencing productivity is useful to develop management strategies in species of conservation concern or subject to exploitation. We studied productivity (covey size and young/adult ratio) of red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) in Spain through a large-scale sampling in Andalucia and Castilla-La Mancha, two large areas in central-southern Spain, the core of the distribution of the species. We evaluated potential environmental factors related with productivity that have been considered important in previous local studies (weather, land use, and intensity of releases of farm-reared partridges), using a dataset of 15,357 observations of partridges over three breeding seasons (2010, 2011, and 2012). Average productivity at the end of July was 3 young/adult, indicating 50% chick mortality between hatching and fledging and high breeding failure. We found marked effects of weather, year, and land use on partridge productivity, confirming some previous results at local scale and supporting widespread and simultaneous effects of these factors. We also detected a large-scale negative relationship with farm-bred partridge release intensities, with lower young/adult ratios in areas with high release intensity. This suggests that partridge releases may be contributing to the decline of wild populations. Our results support that correcting the effects of agricultural intensification is the main key to the long-term conservation of the species and suggest that, in dry spring years (leading to low average productivity), many populations could be exposed to overhunting. These results stress the importance of both small- and large-scale adjustments of hunting pressure to partridge productivity, in order to preserve wild populations. Poor hunting bags in "bad" years, along with the increasing demand in the hunting market, may have stimulated the widespread use of releases, further reducing productivity and leading to the current compromised conservation status of wild populations. We discuss some potential solutions to this conflicting situation from the socioeconomic and environmental points of view.

AB  - The interaction between hunting interests and legally protected predators is often a contentious conservation problem, requiring detailed understanding of predator responses to game management. This issue was addressed in southern Portugal in a treatment-control natural experiment, whereby the abundances of small game, corvids, birds of prey and carnivores were compared in 12 game estates (> 500 ha) and 12 matching areas with similar sizes and land uses but no game management. European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), Iberian hares (Lepus granatensis) and, less so, red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) were far more numerous in game estates than elsewhere. Among legally controlled species, there were less Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius) but more red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in game estates, though the latter were primary targets of predator culling. Fox abundance within game estates varied inversely with an index of management intensity (density of small game feeding sites) and increased along with hare abundance. As for protected species, only common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and genets (Genetta genetta) were fewer in game estates. The abundance of raptors within game estates varied inversely with gamekeeper density, whereas that of common buzzards (Buteo buteo) increased along with rabbit abundance. Overall, there was little evidence that game management reduced local predator abundances, except in the most intensively managed estates. Game estates provided concentrations of prey that was scarce elsewhere, which may have favoured increased abundances of some predators. Further investigations are needed to find out whether high prey densities may attract predators to game estates with increased mortality risk, which may thus become population sinks for protected species.

AB  - In two areas of the district of Huesca (Spain) the age and sex ratios of declining Red-legged Partridge (Alectoris rufa) populations were studied between 1985 and 1987, and were compared with data found in previous studies. Declining Red-legged partridge populations in the Province of Huesca, in contrast to stable ones, are characterized by age ratios < 1 while sex ratio and adult sex ratio > 1 due to poor habitat quality (ecotone absence, low diversity, and great agricultural impact), overabundance of antropophilous predators and excessive hunting pressure, which reduces the survival of hens and chicks. Unfavourable yearly climate variations induce mortality of juvenile and adult hens. Bag limits must consider not only density, but also population structure and habitat quality. Habitat restoration, bag management, and antropophilous predator control are necessary as well as urgent measures to guarantee the viability of Red-legged Partridge populations.

AB  - Like many bird species, climate change is negatively impacting Barbary partridge's ( Alectoris barbara) development and conservation in its natural environment. This study aims to analyse habitats and factors affecting presence of this species in different Moroccan regions. Data collected over four years (2021 to 2024) during hunting periods, supplemented with data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database, the MaxEnt model and the geographic information system were used to predict the current and future distribution of partridge, with an evaluation of variables contributions using the jackknife test. Model accuracy was confirmed by a high AUC value, based on 1705 occurrence records. A strong correlation between the occurrence probability of Barbary partridge and eight climate variables is revealed, classified according to the ISPI index. The most influential variables are Min Temperature of Coldest-Month (0.401), followed by Max Temperature of Warmest- Month (0.185), Temperature Annual Range (0.17), Mean Temperature of Wettest-Quarter (0.164), Mean diurnal range (0.133), Temperature Seasonality (0.121), Annual Precipitation (0.118), and Mean Temperature of Coldest-Quarter (0.109). Potential distributions of partridge are concentrated in Rif and the Middle-Atlas mountainous, mainly in Tangier-Tetouan-AlHoceima and Fez-Meknes regions, where the climate is moderate. Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region is very promising due to its favorable environment. Arid areas show low presence due to drought and high temperatures. Under radiative forcing scenarios of the ACCESS-CM2 climate model, future distribution of partridge in Morocco shows significant variations among periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060. Thus, habitat area suitable for Barbary partridge is expected to show a significant upward trend.

AB  - Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) are a species of conservation concern throughout western North America. Obtaining valid population estimates is essential to understanding population trajectories and the effects of management. Counts of male sage-grouse attending leks during the breeding season are used directly as a population index or to estimate the breeding population size by assuming a detection probability and sex ratio. In the latter case, managers often assume a 2:1 female-biased ratio. However, this sex ratio has not been validated and may result in biased population estimates. We evaluated sex ratios at hatch, 42 days of age, and at harvest to determine if sex ratios were biased for sage-grouse in Utah. Sex ratios at hatch and at 42 days of age did not differ from parity. Harvest data suggested that sage-grouse may exhibit a slight female-biased sex ratio (1.458:1) in the fall. Wildlife management agencies should use caution when using lek count data to estimate population size if sex ratios have not been validated. (c) 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is the most important gamebird in Spain. Due to population declines in recent decades, management approaches increasingly include the release of farm-reared partridges and the establishment of so-called intensive estates, where hunting is based on put-and-take partridges. The release of farm-reared partridges is controversial because these birds negatively affect wild populations. However, according to managers, releases are necessary to maintain commercial hunting. We analysed economic parameters using data provided by 20 red-legged partridge hunting estates with different management and economic aims in central Spain. We calculated total revenues, total expenses, benefits and profitability of these estates and simulated results under two different scenarios (prices for buying farm-reared partridges being 15 % higher and prices for hunting in estates not using releases being 15 % higher) attempting to mimic the internalization of some ecological costs of farm-reared birds or possible rewards from using wild populations sustainably. Non-commercial estates (n = 5), as expected, just broke even, with almost no benefits. Benefits of intensive estates, where massive releases throughout the hunting season allow a much higher harvest, were on average an order of magnitude higher (20,404 +/- 24,413(sic)/km(2), n = 8) than those of other commercial estates (1713 +/- 1280(sic)/km(2), n = 7). Benefits of non-intensive commercial estates using releases were on average lower than those of commercial estates without releases. In fact, profitability of non-intensive commercial estates not using releases was similar to that of intensive estates. Any of the two price scenarios considered led to non-intensive commercial estates not using releases being the most profitable on average. Thus, efforts should bemade to identify ways of improving economic profitability of non-intensive estates, which may be important for promoting hunting management styles that are ecologically more beneficial.

AB  - Persistent organochlorine residues such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), chlorocyclodienes, and the DDT group (DDTs) were determined in fat and muscle samples of resident red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) hunted in Spain. Chlorinated contamination pattern varied largely depending on geographical distribution. Birds collected from the northern part of Spain contained greater concentrations of lindane (34.4 ng/g fat basis) than those from central or southern Spain. In contrast, red-legged partridges collected in southern locations exhibited elevated levels of p,p'-DDE (62.3 ng/g fat basis) as compared with central (31.2 ng/g fat basis) and northern areas (5.6 ng/g fat basis). The only cyclodiene detected, dieldrin, showed higher amounts (3.4 ng/g fat basis) in partridges collected in central Spain. The sex differences in pollutant occurrence and concentrations were negligible. One-year-old birds accumulated greater concentrations of beta-HCH, and dieldrin than older birds. Global comparison of organochlorine concentrations indicated that northern partridges are more contaminated by compounds of industrial origin, whereas southern birds contained greater amounts of agricultural chemicals. Estimates of hazards associated with organochlorine levels in resident red-legged partridges in Spain suggested that southern birds may be at risk from exposure to DDTs, and northern birds may be affected by excessive concentrations of Lindane. The use of red-legged partridge as bioindicator for OCP contamination is discussed.

AB  - As a hunted species becomes increasingly rare, the effort required to locate and harvest an individual tends to increase. As rarity increases, governmental oversight, including changes in hunting regulations and protection of habitats and individuals using mechanisms such as the US Endangered Species Act (ESA), can be used to mitigate extinction risks. However, recent research has demonstrated the existence of a feedback mechanism through which increased rarity may increase hunter demand for opportunities to pursue rare species before the opportunity is lost. This phenomenon, referred to as the anthropogenic Allee effect, may exacerbate exploitation, thereby resulting in disproportionally large effects of harvest on vulnerable species. In 2010, the US Fish and Wildlife Service designated greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) as a candidate for listing under the ESA. Although sage-grouse are a candidate for ESA listing, they are still hunted throughout much of their current range. In 2008, the demand for sage-grouse hunting permits in Utah exceeded their availability, raising questions about why hunters choose to pursue this species. We hypothesized that the pending ESA listing decision increased hunter demand for permits. We surveyed randomly selected hunters who obtained permits to hunt sage-grouse in Utah in 2008-2010 (n=838) to determine their motivations for hunting sage-grouse and determinants of hunter satisfaction. The most commonly reported reasons for hunting sage-grouse were to spend time with family, for tradition and meat. Although the potential ESA listing was not a major motivational factor in 2009 or 2010, the percentage of respondents selecting this option did increase by 7%. Hunter awareness of the ESA listing petition also increased by 18% during this period. Our results provide new insights on the sociological importance and potential threats of hunting rare species.

AB  - The release of hand-reared ring-necked pheasants Phasianus colchicus in summer is a common practice in Britain to increase the number of birds available to hunters in winter. The breeding success of the birds which survive the shooting season is poor. Traditionally, birds are provided with supplementary wheat grain from release until the end of the shooting season (I February) to maintain body condition and to help hold birds in areas for hunting. During 19972000 we assessed the effect of continuing supplementary feeding into spring on pheasant density and breeding success on seven private shooting estates. On each estate we randomly selected two distinct 1-km(2) plots and provided wheat grain via feed hoppers for birds in breeding territories in one of the plots on each estate while the other plot acted as an untreated control. Food was provided from mid-February to mid-May. We crossed-over the treatment and control plot on each estate each year. We conducted pre- and post-breeding pheasant counts in the plots during April and September. During April, densities were higher in treatment plots than in control plots for territorial males: (mean SE) treatment = 22.6 +/- 1.5 birds/km(2), control = 14.8 +/- 1.2 birds/km(2), (P < 0.001) and for females: treatment = 40.6 +/- 5.8 birds/km(2), control = 24.1 +/- 3.8 birds/km(2) (P < 0.001). In September we found no statistical effect of treatment on densities of adult birds or on brood size. However, more young were observed on treatment plots: 10.8 +/- 1.5 birds/km(2), than in control plots: 5.6 +/- 1.0 birds/km(2), (P = 0.02). In order to improve the breeding potential of released pheasants, we recommend that spring supplementary feeding is undertaken on shooting estates in Britain.

AB  - Populations of sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) in the upper Midwest are in danger of extirpation due to habitat loss caused by succession, tree planting, and control of wildfire. Sharp-tailed grouse in Wisconsin have persisted primarily on reserves maintained in early succession using prescribed burning and mechanical disturbance. However, during the late 1990s the highest and densest populations of sharp-tailed grouse in Wisconsin were found in a complex of clearcuts in southeastern Douglas County. We compared landcover composition and fragmentation at multiple scales within 2.4 km of 36 sharp-tailed grouse leks and 213 unused locations in a 1,350-km(2) study area in the pine barrens of northwestern Wisconsin. Leks were located on managed reserves (n = 11) and habitats recently created by timber harvest (n = 23) and wildfire (n = 2). Leks were clustered in the landscape, with distance to nearest neighbour lek shorter for leks than unused points. Leks were characterized by higher proportions of grass and shrub cover classes, lower proportions of forest, fewer forest patches, and greater distances to forest edge relative to unused points. Proportions of grass and shrub cover classes, distance to nearest lek, and distance to forest edge were strong predictors of lek presence in a logistic regression model. Differences between leks and unused points varied with scale of sampling. Response of sharp-tailed grouse to indices of fragmentation varied among scales and metrics. Number of sharp-tailed grouse attending leks was positively associated with recently created habitat and proportion of grass cover in the landscape.

AB  - Populations of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have declined throughout the species' range. We evaluated metal concentrations in livers sampled from greater sage-grouse collected from hunters in Eureka County, Nevada, during autumn of 2008 and 2010. We make local comparisons of metal concentrations between two populations of greater sage-grouse in Eureka County, as well as regional comparisons with previously reported values for greater sage-grouse collected in Wyoming and Montana. With one exception, tissue concentrations of lead, arsenic, and mercury were below method detection limits. Mean concentrations of iron, molybdenum, and zinc differed between the two Nevada populations, and magnesium, cadmium, molybdenum, and selenium differed between greater sage-grouse in eastern Nevada, and values reported for Wyoming and Montana. In contrast, we found no evidence for local variation in magnesium, copper, cadmium, or selenium, or for regional variation in iron, zinc, or copper. Of particular interest were low selenium concentrations in our study system relative to Wyoming and Montana. Some individuals in our study returned liver selenium values considered consistent with selenium deficiency in domestic poultry. This research adds to the small body of literature on background contaminant levels in greater sage-grouse, and provides evidence for geographic variation in metal concentrations at local and regional scales.

AB  - We conducted spring and autumn surveys of Caucasian black grouse Tetrao mlokosiewiczi throughout northeastern Turkey during 2004-2005. Birds were found at 45 locations, 29 of which were previously undocumented. The species appears to occur in four geographical units with differing degrees of connectivity and isolation, and is still under pressure from illegal hunting as well as habitat deterioration and fragmentation, principally as the result of road construction in mountain areas. A preliminary analysis of the degree of overlap between grouse populations and protected areas shows that the protected areas network should be reviewed. The data collected during the course of this survey are being used to develop a model for predicting the distribution of black grouse in northeastern Turkey and to prepare a National Species Action Plan. A detailed ecological study of the Caucasian black grouse is required to develop habitat management recommendations for the species.

AB  - We investigated population growth rate (lambda) for a Merriam's wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami) population in the northern Black Hills, South Dakota, USA. We constructed and evaluated a females-only matrix population model. Our estimate of asymptotic lambda, derived from estimates of vital rates obtained from 2016-2018 was 0.74 (95% CI = 0.60, 0.88), which indicates that the vital rates were inadequate to sustain the population. Elasticity values were highest for changes in adult survival probability followed by, in order, changes in juvenile survival, yearling survival, and adult reproduction. We could only achieve stable or growing populations (i.e., lambda >= 1) by increasing the probability of adult and yearling survival (holding all other vital rates constant). Estimated adult survival rate in the work reported here was lower than values reported for other populations in the Black Hills; therefore, managing for increased female survival (>= 0.68) may be the most practical strategy for promoting wild turkey population growth in this system. We recommend no female harvest during any open turkey season.

AB  - There are few published observations regarding the phenomenon of mycophagy in birds, the Ruffed Grouse being no exception. Twenty hunter-killed Ruffed Grouse crops were acquired in the Thunder Bay District from 22 September to 18 October, 2010, and examined for the presence of consumed fungal tissue. Four crops were found to contain intact remains of fruiting bodies. Based on cystidia and spore morphological characters, the specimens recovered were found to belong to three genera: Lactarius.

AB  - The provision of ecosystem services via ecological restoration can be affected by the spatially explicit relationships between existing landscape characteristics and the proposed restoration. In such situations, effective economic targeting of restoration is aided by an accounting of the spatially explicit linkages between initial restoration actions, the resulting changes in ecosystem services, and the changes in economic benefits to individuals resulting from changes in the provision of ecosystem services. To this end, we examine the impact of landscape heterogeneity on economic benefits of USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) restoration for ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) hunters in Michigan by linking a previously developed ecological production function of ring-necked pheasant sightings to a recreation demand model of hunter site choice. Using proposed pheasant habitat restoration in Michigan as a framework for our analysis, we find that economic benefits generated by restoration depend critically upon the landscape selected for CRP restoration. Poorly targeted restoration sites yield near-zero economic benefits, while well-targeted investments yield about 2.4 times the economic benefits of the median parcel. The results show how managers can use both ecological and hunter behavior information to enhance the return on conservation investments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Europe, hunting and game management are centuries-old activities that have had profound effects on the landscapes and the biodiversity they support. Game management is a potentially important tool to enhance game populations and may also affect other wildlife. We investigated the relationship between red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa game management and steppe-bird abundance in central Spain. We surveyed 54 red-legged partridge hunting estates with varying game-management intensity in spring and/or summer in 2006 and 2008-2010. Information about game management was gathered through questionnaires to game managers. Birds were counted from fixed points and the amount of different land uses in each point was visually estimated. Our results show that the abundance of granivorous species (sandgrouse) increased significantly with the density of feeders, whereas non-granivorous species were more abundant in estates with more intensive fox control, although the latter relationship was weaker. Land-use variables, specifically agricultural lands, appeared in the models of all the groups considered. Therefore, there is an option for designing optimal management for red-legged partridge estates that potentially benefits non-target species: an effective combination of habitat management, adequate use of supplementary food and water, and possibly selective legal predator control when necessary and effective for the target game species, although the latter needs further investigation.

KW  - ECOLOGY
AB  - A goal of many resource selection studies is to identify those habitats selected by a species. However, favorability of a particular habitat feature is likely contingent on such factors as landscape composition, predation risk, and an individual's resource needs. Thus, habitat selection may vary depending on context, and identifying causes of variability in habitat use could increase our understanding of functional aspects of a species' habitat ecology. Clear-cuts afford ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) important escape cover, whereas access routes (roads and trails) and mesic bottomlands are viewed as important foraging areas for this species. We present a study of factors influencing strength of selection (i.e., use-availability) for these 3 habitat features by individual ruffed grouse. We analyzed radiotelemetry data from > 1,000 ruffed grouse monitored on 10 study sites in the central and southern Appalachians. Five sites were typified by mixed-mesophytic forests, and 5 were predominantly oak-hickory forests. Selection for clear-cuts was positively related to selection for access routes, but it was inversely related to selection for mesic bottomlands. Selection for mesic bottomlands and selection for access routes were positively related in oak-hickory forests, but they were unrelated in mixed-mesophytic forests. Clear-cuts were more strongly selected in mixed-mesophytic forests, and within each forest type, use of clear-cuts was strongest by adult males. Mesic bottomlands were only selected in oak-hickory forests, and within these forests they were most strongly selected by adult females. Following poor, hard-mast crops, use of access routes by female grouse increased. Use of clear-cuts and bottomlands increased for some or all sex and age classes of grouse following closure of hunting, suggesting that hunting discouraged use of these covers. Animals typically face a trade-off between survival and condition to maximize fitness, and our observations suggest that (relative to one another) male grouse favor refuging habitats whereas females favor foraging areas. At a landscape scale, grouse in areas having oak-hickory forests selected foraging habitats more strongly, whereas those inhabiting mixed-mesophytic forests made greater use of escape cover. Our findings indicate that habitat management prescriptions for Appalachian grouse can be tailored by forest type.

AB  - The black grouse Lyrurus tetrix and the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus are known to produce hybrids in wild populations. In general, these hybrids are regarded as infertile; however, conclusive evidence that F1-hybrids are infertile and unable to backcross in the wild are lacking. Using a molecular approach, we examined the ancestry of a bird assumed to be a male hybrid based on phenotypic characters. The specimen was legally shot during the hunting season in northern Norway in an area where the black grouse is common and the capercaillie is relatively rare. Analysis of the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA revealed that the mother of the specimen was of capercaillie origin, while a diagnostic sex-chromosome (Z) linked microsatellite marker showed that the father had a black grouse allele. Diagnostic autosomal microsatellite markers revealed that the specimen was a backcross and not a first-generation hybrid. As galliform birds follow Haldane's rule, i.e., that hybrid sterility is common in the heterogametic sex (female in birds), the hybrid parent of the backcross was, thus, likely a male. Our findings provide molecular evidence that capercaillie x black grouse F1-hybrid males can be fertile and successfully mate and backcross in a wild population.

AB  - The releasing of farm-reared pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) is a very common practice in order to sustain high hunting pressures. However farm-reared birds may be carriers of parasites and diseases for the natural populations. We compared the parasite egg and oocyst prevalence and abundance of excretions found in faecal droppings collected in 13 different protected areas of Tuscany: seven areas where farm-reared pheasants are released every year to increase the reproduction and dispersion of the wild population (restocking areas) and in six areas where the production of pheasants is guaranteed only by the wild population (wild areas). Eimeria spp. oocysts were found in 33 of 129 (25.6%) samples collected in wild areas and in 59 of 119 (51.3%) of samples collected in restocking areas. Nematode eggs were found in 21 of 129 (16.3%) samples collected in wild areas and in 59 of 119 (49.6%) of samples collected in restocking areas. Significant differences were found for Capillaria spp. (31.9% of restocking areas vs. 9.3% of wild areas) and Syngamus spp. (10.1% of restocking areas vs. 3.1% of wild areas) but not for Heterakis or Ascaridia spp. (7.6% of restocking areas vs. 3.9% of wild areas). Parasitic excretion abundance was higher in the droppings collected in restocking areas compared to those collected in wild areas, but differences were significant only for Eimeria and Capillaria spp. In order to reduce the risk of spreading parasites and diseases, we suggest to interpose a strip (larger than the home range of the pheasants) where hunting is not forbidden between the restocking areas and the wild areas, and pheasant releases should not be allowed at least within a "pheasant home range distance" from the wild areas.

AB  - We used hunting dogs and man to simulate the searching for nests and broods of forest grouse, i.e. capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and black grouse Tetrao tetrix, by mammalian predators. Our aim was to find out if and how forest fragmentation affects the searching efficiency of predators. In total, we found 73 capercaillie acid 35 black grouse nests and 20 young capercaillie broods. We calculated that a mammalian predator will detect a capercaillie nest if closer than 1.6 m (95% C.I.: 0.7 - 2.2), a black grouse nest if closer than 1.1 m (95% C.I.: 0.8 - 1.6), and a capercaillie brood if closer than 39 m (95% C.I: 17 - 89). Nests were distributed in all habitat types, whereas broods were restricted to specific brood habitats. Due to this and the difference in the detection radius between nests and broods, we estimated that the predator gain of searching for broods in brood habitat is about 80 times higher than the gain of searching for nests which are situated in all habitat types in our study area. As young broods concentrate in highly restricted habitats, the predator gain of searching for broods increases exponentially with the loss of brood habitat, whereas it decreases linearly with increasing nest predation. We discuss this mechanism as a possible process explaining the observed decline in capercaillie populations in fragmented forests and consider its implications for grouse management.

AB  - We evaluated the application of using an additive harvest mortality model (AHMM) as a harvest management strategy for northern bobwhites Colinus virginianus during the 2007/08 and 2008/09 hunting seasons in two ecoregions of Texas: the Rolling Plains (RP) and the South Texas Plains (STP). We collected field data on three study sites/ecoregion (of 4001,900 ha each; two treatment and one control) to estimate four demographic parameters (i.e. fall and spring density, overwinter survival in the absence of hunting and harvest rate). We used these data to parameterize an AHMM (a theoretical component of sustained-yield harvest; SYH) for bobwhites and compare model-based predictions of spring bobwhite populations with field estimates. Our goal was to compare predictions from the AHMM to field estimates of spring density based on known rates of harvest. Compared to field estimates, the AHMM consistently underestimated spring population density (mean % +/- SE) by 55.7 +/- 17.8% (2007/08) and 34.1 +/- 4.9% (2008/09) in the RP and by 26.4 +/- 25.3% (2007/08) and 49.1 +/- 2.1% (2008/09) in the STP. Prescribing a fall bobwhite harvest to achieve a specific, target spring density may be difficult given the wide variation in the model parameters (i.e. fall and spring density, and natural mortality) that we observed.

AB  - Overexploitation is a critical threat to the survival of many species. The global demand for wildlife products has attracted considerable research attention, but regional species exploitation histories are more rarely investigated. We interviewed 169 villagers living around seven terrestrial nature reserves on Hainan Island, China, with the aim of reconstructing historical patterns of hunting and consumption of local wildlife, including the globally threatened Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) and Hainan peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron katsumatae), from the mid-20th century onwards. We aimed to better understand the relationship between these past activities and current consumption patterns. Our findings suggest that eating pangolin meat was not a traditional behaviour in Hainan, with past consumption prohibited by local myths about pangolins. In contrast, local consumption of peacock-pheasant meat was a traditional activity. However, later attitudes around hunting pangolins and peacock-pheasants in Hainan were influenced by pro-hunting policies and a state-run wildlife trade from the 1960s to the 1980s. These new social norms still shape the daily lifestyles and perceptions of local people towards wildlife consumption in Hainan today. Due to these specific historical patterns of wildlife consumption, local-adapted interventions such as promoting substitute meat choices and alternative livelihoods might be effective at tackling local habits of consuming wild meat. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the local historical contexts of wildlife use for designing appropriate conservation strategies.

AB  - Successful management practices for declining bird species depend often on long-term surveys acquired by point counts. Despite high standardization of field protocols, uncertain detection probability remains an important source of variability and bias in point-count data. This effect is of main importance in low-responsive species as the Red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), but it can be counterbalanced, increasing detection probability. In this 2-year study, we sampled using traditional point-count methods, followed by playback sessions for each repetition. We measured detection probability and the efficiency of playback for detectability in the context of a feasibility study on long-term point-count surveys for a harvested game bird, the Red-legged partridge. The results for both study years show a distinct increase in detection probability (23% and 45%, respectively) when using playback vs. the traditional point-count method. We also tested our results for heterogeneity, trap dependence, and time dependence, and no effect was detected. Thus, we suggest that the future design of long-term surveys on Red-legged partridges should consider abundance indices using playback sessions.

AB  - The grey partridge Perdix perdix is an important management concern in the European farmland. Pair numbers severely declined during the 20th century. As a result, the species has been listed in SPEC category 3, i.e. 'Unfavourable' conservation status in Europe. The largest population of western Europe occurs in France. Its status there is, therefore, decisive for the European conservation status of the species as well as for the future of the species. Populations of partridges in central northern France have been routinely surveyed since the 1980s for hunting management purposes. In this paper, we use this long-term and wide-scale survey to portray the demographic status of partridge populations. We emphasise the amplitude of spatio-temporal variations in breeding densities. In the 2000s, a number of areas where agriculture is intensive and where the species is hunted still sustain > 50 pairs/km(2), whereas densities are < 5 pairs/ km(2) in other areas. These low densities are, however, higher than those commonly reported from other parts of Europe. Density levels exhibit large differences at a small spatial scale and show large year-to-year fluctuations which make trend assessment difficult. The 1994-2004 and 1999-2004 trends displayed different patterns; densities increased, decreased or were stable depending upon agricultural region.

AB  - The goal of the study was to investigate the accumulation and spatial patterns of spent lead (Pb) shot pellets and the prevalence of shot ingestion in red-legged partridge in a driven shooting estate. Soil was collected using a regular sampling design perpendicular to three shooting lines. Factors involved in shot spatial distribution were investigated by a causal structural equation model (SEM). Shot ingestion prevalence and liver and bone Pb concentrations were studied in partridges hunted in 2004 and 2006. Shot soil-burden averaged 73 600 units/ha (i.e., 8.1 kg/ha). Shot density was significantly higher in front of than behind shooting lines, with greatest accumulation occurring at between 40-110 m and in certain ecotones (i.e., shrubland-dry cropland). Analyses revealed 7.8% of partridges with evidence of Pb shot ingestion. Particle size in diet, grit-size composition, and shot ingestion prevalence were significantly higher in 2004 than in 2006, indicating that supplying partridges with large seeds (i.e., corn) may increase the risk of Pb shot ingestion. Moving shooting lines into croplands and controlling seed size used for diet supplementation may reduce shot ingestion.

AB  - Falcipennis canadensis (Spruce Grouse) are a habitat specialist of coniferous forest in North America and typically have large home ranges (approximate to 25 ha, range = 22-75 ha). Although this species is sensitive to logging, few studies report abundance and population trends in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation. In early May of 1997 to 1999, we surveyed Spruce Grouse in 21 riparian and 27 upland residual forest strips (width = 51-132 m) located within six clear-cut landscapes (23256 km(2)) of southcentral Quebec, Canada. We also surveyed five control sites in uncut continuous forest surrounding one landscape. Contrary to our prediction that Spruce Grouse would not be observed from such narrow strips, they were detected in 24 of the 48 strips. Both types of strips had similar occurrence rates and abundance indices (2.01 +/- 0.46 [SE] males/10 stations in riparian strips, 1.29 +/- 0.35 males/10 stations in upland strips). Because of the age of adjacent cuts (mean = 4.2 years, range = 2-8 years), crowding of grouse that were present at logging time into forest strips does not adequately explain the numbers of Spruce Grouse in these structures. Therefore, we conclude that Spruce Grouse observed in forest strips have either immigrated from outside or were local recruits. Despite persistence of Spruce Grouse in residual forests of logged landscapes, we suggest a cautious approach to forest management since the species' long-term persistence could be jeopardized if residual forest strips are harvested.

AB  - Anti-predator behavior can be costly to prey species and the consequences of these decisions may affect survival. Interactions between humans and hunted species can lead to behavioral shifts in the animal that affect hunter satisfaction and possibly fitness of the animals. We assessed the influence of multiple factors that may affect anti-predator behavior in a commonly harvested game bird, the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), during October 2013-March 2015 on a private plantation in South Carolina, USA. We monitored bobwhite-hunter interactions during hunting events (n=40) using radio-telemetry and behavioral observations. We investigated bobwhite anti-predator behavior in 2 contexts, choice of evasive tactic and timing of tactic deployment (i.e., level of wariness), using a combination of linear regression and multinomial models in a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate the approach style of the hunter (i.e., pointing dog) and vegetation density affect the evasive tactic used. Dense vegetation at 0.6m above ground height promoted hiding behavior of bobwhites, whereas approaching pointing dogs (i.e., not holding point) promoted flushing. Also, dense vegetation at 0.3m above ground height and previous exposure to a discharged firearm elicited an earlier anti-predator response. Our results imply that bobwhites make context-specific decisions regarding hunter evasion, which may be a result of associative learning. Managers may be able to increase bobwhite-hunter encounters and improve hunter satisfaction by maintaining vegetation structure between 0.6 and 1.3m to promote hiding behavior throughout the hunting season. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.        During hunter interactions, bobwhites held more frequently in dense vegetation 0.6m above ground height, flushed more often when encountered by moving pointing dogs, and exhibited learning behaviors from previous exposure to hunters. Proper vegetation management to provide the optimal structure while minimizing dense vegetation (i.e., mat forming grasses) at the ground level will foster increased opportunities to detect coveys and improve hunter satisfaction.

AB  - Rangelands, produced by grazing herbivores, are important for a variety of agricultural, hunting, recreation and conservation objectives world-wide. Typically, there is little quantitative evidence regarding the magnitude of the grazing impact of different herbivores on rangeland habitats to inform their management.        We quantified the grazing and trampling impact of sheep, cattle, red deer Cervus elaphus, rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, mountain hares Lepus timidus and red grouse Lagopus lagopus on open-hill habitats in 11 areas of upland Scotland. The degradation of heather in upland Scotland Calluna vulgaris-dominated habitats, of conservation significance at a European scale, has been attributed, anecdotally, to increasing sheep and red deer populations.        Field indicators of habitat condition were used to generate a five-point scale of impact in vegetation polygons of seven habitats. The presence of each herbivore species was attributed on the basis of 'signs' of occupancy. A Bayesian regression model was used to analyse the association of herbivore species with grazing impact on plant communities, controlling for environmental attributes.        Overall the presence of sheep was associated with the largest increase (7/11 areas) in grazing and trampling impact of all herbivores. Cattle had the second largest impact but generally this was restricted to fewer areas and habitats than sheep. In contrast, impacts associated with wild herbivores tended to be small and only significant locally.        Although red deer presence was associated with a significantly lower impact than sheep, this impact increased with increasing deer density at both land-ownership and regional scales. For sheep there was little or no evidence of density dependence.        Synthesis and applications. The higher impact associated with sheep presence probably reflects their greater aggregation because of their limited ranging behaviour, exacerbated by sheep being herded in places convenient for land managers. Consequently, future reductions in sheep numbers as a result of reform of European Union farming policies may limit the extent of their impact, but not necessarily the local magnitude. However, reductions in sheep stocks may lead to increases in deer densities, with greater impact, particularly in heather-dominated habitats. Where habitat conservation is a priority this may well require a reduction in deer numbers.

AB  - Dusky Grouse ( Dendragapus obscurus) ) are an under-monitored game species in Montana and elsewhere across their distribution. Without population monitoring it is difficult to establish appropriate harvest regulations or understand the impact of environmental disturbances (e.g., timber harvest, climate change) on populations. As a first step toward developing methods for unbiased population monitoring, we must identify appropriate sampling sites, which requires knowledge of Dusky Grouse habitat. Our goal was to explore relationships between Dusky Grouse use and habitat characteristics, and then generate a state-wide map predicting Dusky Grouse habitat in Montana using two methods: resource selection functions and random forest classifiers. The Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program provided a multi-year dataset of Dusky Grouse observations, which we reduced to detected (n=132) and pseudo-absent (n=5960) locations, using geospatial datasets to obtain topographic and vegetation characteristics for each location. We evaluated the predictability of the two models using receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve (ROC/ AUC) with k-fold cross validation and classification accuracy of an independent dataset of incidental Dusky Grouse locations. We found both models to be highly predictive and multiple habitat characteristics were found to help predict relative probability of use such as proportion of trees with a height of 16-20m and conifer forest vegetation types. We converted both models to binary values and used an ensemble (frequency histogram) approach to combine the models into a final predictive map. Consensus between the resource selection function and random forest models was high (93%) and the ensemble map had higher predictive accuracy when classifying the independent dataset than the other two models. Our results show that our ensembled model approach was able to accurately predict potential Dusky Grouse habitat and therefore can be used to delineate areas for future population monitoring of Dusky Grouse in Montana.

AB  - The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is abundant in a number of regions in Spain and one of the most commonly hunted small game species in the country. Partridge hunting generates substantial income in rural areas where agriculture is less profitable. A traditional hunting method, reclamo hunting, is currently under revision by the European Commission's (EC) Birds Directive because hunting may fall within the reproduction period of the species. So far, only limited data on the reproductive phenology of the species exist to inform a policy change. In this study, we present reproduction data for red-legged partridges from 9 hunting estates in Andalusia during 1 year, and over 3 consecutive seasons from a control estate. We used direct nest and partridge chick covey observations to estimate 165 egg-laying dates. We found significant differences between sites related to altitude during reproduction periods. Using our pooled data, we showed that reproduction occurred between the last 10 days in January and the middle of February; beyond 31 January we observed an exponential increase in birds reproduction. According to these data and current EC legislation, reclamo hunting should not extend beyond 31 January. (C) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Greater Prairie Chickens started their range expansion from Wisconsin about 1900. They reached Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, by 1925 and completed colonization of Manitoulin Island by 1945. In the fall of 1932, an irruption of Northern Sharp-tailed Grouse from the Hudson Bay Lowlands occurred. Residents of Manitoulin distinguished the two species and reported the presence of "square-tails" and "sharp-tails" in the winter of 1932-1933. There is no specimen evidence or verbal reports that Northern Sharp-tailed Grouse reached Michigan during that irruption. Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse were in the northern peninsula of Michigan by 1930. In 1941, Michigan Department of Natural Resources made a planting of 37 Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse on Drummond Island. Thence they spread east and the first lek was found at the west end of Manitoulin Island in 1952. By 1960, these birds had virtually colonized the whole island. Development of a hybrid index from the morphology of specimens of skins and skeletons from Manitoulin indicated that more than 50% of all birds in the 1960s were hybrids. In Michigan, less than 1% of the birds necropsied or checked in hunters' bags were hybrid. It seems likely that ethological isolation broke down on Manitoulin Island. The booming display of the Prairie Chicken and the tail rattling display of the Sharp-tailed Grouse can be broken down into their component parts. They appear to be homologous to five discrete displays of the Spruce Grouse, grouped in different patterns in each of the two lek species. There was little hybridization between Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse and Prairie Chickens that had lived sympatrically for thousands of years. Northern Sharp-tailed Grouse had probably never lived sympatrically with Prairie Chickens and the evolution of the perception of species distinctions may not have evolved to the point where hybridization was restricted to a rare event.

AB  - The release of farm-reared animals for shooting causes frequent conflicts between hunters and conservationists, since, while this management practice is economically important in some game areas, it carries several risks for biodiversity conservation (e.g. the introduction of new pathogens or the release of alien species and/or hybrids). However, these conflicts have received little attention in the literature. In particular, social-psychological factors, which are very important driving conservation conflicts, have been often ignored in the study of releases. Our main goal was to examine attitudes and beliefs of game managers towards the release of farm-reared red-legged partridges in small-game estates within central Spain, where more than 3 million partridges are released annually. Data were collected through face to face interviews with 45 game managers. More than 70% of the interviewed managers expressed negative views towards releases, and these included arguments about their detrimental effect on natural partridge populations, their low effectiveness, and their consideration as artificial hunting. Very negative views predominated among managers who had never released partridges (mostly those of non-commercial estates), and were frequently expressed by those who released partridges occasionally. In contrast, positive views were mostly given by managers who released partridges annually, and arguments used generally referred to the economic benefits of releases. Some managers expressed at the same time both positive and negative views on releases (i.e. ambivalent position). These findings suggest that there exists a relative polarisation among game managers, and that the position of those who were very critical of releases is close to that of conservationists. Our results also suggest that managers' decision-making regarding releases is likely influenced by a variety of beliefs and attitudes as well as the socioeconomic setting (e.g. economic interest in the outcome of the behaviour). This highlights that the study of different aspects, including social and psychological as well as economic, is essential for understanding and resolving conservation conflicts, such as those caused by releases.

AB  - Harvest data are commonly used as proxy for count data, especially in studies of long-term temporal and spatial patterns of population fluctuations. However, usually the concurrence of the conclusions based on different types of data is impossible to verify due to the lack of count data. Here, we use annual (1964-2004) harvest and population census data for capercaillie, black grouse and hazel grouse from 14 game management districts covering Finland, and demonstrate some mismatch in the information that these data sets provide. Overall, linear regressions of annual harvest against population count give a reasonable fit, but the slopes are less than 1 in every species. Harvest bags have been proportionally larger in north and eastern Finland than in southwestern Finland, with marked species-specific differences. Considering population variation, the CV% in the census data (30-50%) is consistently smaller than it is in the harvest data (60-70%). Most importantly, conclusions on the spatio-temporal patterns of the population dynamics are different if based on harvest rather than count data. In capercaillie, synchrony decreases faster with distance according to the harvest data, while in black grouse and hazel grouse the census data show the steeper decline. In addition, the autocorrelation coefficients in the census time series are higher in capercaillie and black grouse than in harvest data, but in hazel grouse the opposite is true. Finally, the parameter estimates for a second order autoregressive model using different data sets differ, and these differences are species-specific. Despite the fact that annual harvest is a positive and linear function of annual grouse population density, the pattern of population dynamics derived from the bag data is different from that shown by the census data. This result urges caution in using wildlife bag data as reliable indices of population dynamics.

AB  - Livestock grazing has become the most prevalent human disturbance in protected areas across the range of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Previous studies have documented the impacts of livestock grazing on habitat and food resources of giant panda, however, little is known about how free-ranging livestock influences other sympatric species. In this study, we investigated the presence of livestock on the habitat use and activity patterns of blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentusbe), a representative species of phasianids in China, of which more than 50% are under threats due to habitat loss and fragmentation, illegal harvest and human disturbance. We combined camera-trap and sign survey data collected within Wanglang National Nature Reserve, where the livestock population has increased by nine-fold in the past decade, and used both an occupancy modeling framework and kernel density estimation to understand blood pheasant's recent distribution, changes in occurrences, and diel activity patterns in the presence of free ranging livestock in different seasons (i.e., breeding [April to July], non-breeding [August to October] and winter [November to March]). For diel activity, blood pheasant overlapped highly with livestock regardless of the season, as both are primarily diurnal species. With regards to distribution, we detected a significant positive correlation between the presence of blood pheasants and livestock (P = 0.02) in breeding season which was against our expectation; no significant relationship in non-breeding season; and a significant negative correlation in winter. Besides, livestock had a significant negative correlation with blood pheasant extinction probability, and no significant impact on colonization probability. Aided by results from two-season occupancy modeling, we argued that the spatial co occurrence in breeding season wasn't due to causality, but similar habitat preferences between them. Our study confirms that free-ranging livestock do have the potential to impact blood pheasant due to temporal and spatial overlap, but the consequences of this overlap were unclear.

AB  - In this paper we ask whether we should we re-examine the future of upland gamebird management and greater federal oversight and partnerships in the twenty-first century. Management for waterfowl in North America has been successful because of the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and the subsequent 1986 North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP). Although the MBTA included most migratory and non-migratory species, upland gamebirds, including the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite), were excluded and retained under state control. Although many waterfowl populations have been increasing, bobwhite populations have declined precipitously during much of the period. Excluding non-migratory gamebirds from the MBTA meant that the multistate coordinating efforts that made the MBTA successful for increasing the management of waterfowl have not been applied. The National Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI) has made a strong effort to unite states within the bobwhite range but does not have the federal anchoring and financial support that were given to states by the MBTA and NAWMP and currently integrate adaptive harvest, habitat management, and financial partnerships to acquire and manage wetlands that support waterfowl production. The NBCI Coordinated Implementation Program (CIP) is designed to serve the function of developing and monitoring habitat for bobwhites but is entirely voluntary and dependent entirely on state and non-governmental organization (NGO) funds, lacking federal grants and Federal Duck Stamp funds. To catch up with the successes of waterfowl, we discuss the implications of increasing coordination, partnerships, and funding mechanisms between the federal government, state governments, and NGOs to provide common landscape-level population monitoring and modeling, adaptive harvest regulations, habitat management goals, and a national upland gamebird stamp.

AB  - Recent declines in eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) have prompted increased interest in management and research of this important game species. However, the mechanisms underlying these declines are unclear, leaving uncertainty in how best to manage this species. Foundational to effective management of wildlife species is understanding the biotic and abiotic factors that influence demographic parameters and the contribution of vital rates to population growth. Our objectives for this study were to (1) conduct a literature review to collect all published vital rates for eastern wild turkey over the last 50 years, (2) perform a scoping review of the biotic and abiotic factors that have been studied relative to wild turkey vital rates and highlight areas that require additional research, and (3) use the published vital rates to populate a life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) and identify the vital rates that make the greatest contribution to population growth. Based on published vital rates for eastern wild turkey, we estimated a mean asymptotic population growth rate (lambda) of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.71, 1.12). Vital rates associated with after-second-year (ASY) females were most influential in determining population growth. Survival of ASY females had the greatest elasticity (0.53), while reproduction of ASY females had lower elasticity (0.21), but high process variance, causing it to explain a greater proportion of variance in lambda. Our scoping review found that most research has focused on the effects of habitat characteristics at nest sites and the direct effects of harvest on adult survival, while research on topics such as disease, weather, predators, or anthropogenic activity on vital rates has received less attention. We recommend that future research take a more mechanistic approach to understanding variation in wild turkey vital rates as this will assist managers in determining the most appropriate management approach.

AB  - More than a half century of research on northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in south Texas has provided a legacy of information for ecologists and managers. South Texas is a semiarid and subtropical environment with highly variable weather, a land base consisting of large private ranches devoted to livestock production, a perennial problem of brush encroachment on rangelands, and a strong tradition of fee-lease hunting. These physical, biotic, and social conditions focused research efforts on descriptive natural history (ca. 1930-1980) and evaluation of grazing and brush management practices (ca. 1980-1990). By natural evolution of knowledge, these efforts led to the development of unified theory that synthesized descriptive and applied information about bobwhite management (ca. 1990-2000). In the context of grazing on rangeland subject to encroachment by woody plants, descriptive studies focused on bobwhite home ranges, mobility, flight behavior, nesting cover, resting cover, and whistling posts, among other aspects of habitat use and behavior. The purpose of these studies was to determine how different plant structures and communities should be dispersed in space and time to maximize their value as bobwhite habitat. South Texas studies revealed that the dogmatic principle, "bobwhites are early successional species," holds poorly in semiarid, subtropical environments. Research in south Texas led to formalization of the usable-space-in-time hypothesis on bobwhite density. The hypothesis states that, within ordinary limits, mean abundance of bobwhites on an area is correlated more strongly with the quantity of permanent cover to which they are adapted and less strongly with (human) perceptions of habitat quality (foods, interspersion, edge, diversity). Space-time seems to be an omnibus variable that can be assessed in a variety of management and ecological settings. In association with highly variable rainfall patterns and amounts in south Texas, bobwhite populations exhibit boom-bust population behavior. Research on the cause-effect process governing booms and busts has led to rejection of hypotheses on phosphorus, calcium, phytoestrogens, vitamin A, macronutrition, water, and stress-related hormones as causally involved in the phenomenon. Heat-mediated variation in productivity remains a viable hypothesis that is, of course, open to challenge. The information legacy from research on bobwhites in south Texas has led to revision of knowledge emanating from the southeastern United States; the revised knowledge better fits bobwhites and other quails that inhabit semiarid environments.

AB  - 1. Vigilance increases fitness by improving predator detection but at the expense of increasing starvation risk. We related variation in vigilance among 122 radio-tagged overwintering grey partridges Perdix perdix (L.) across 20 independent farmland sites in England to predation risk (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus L., kill rate), use of alternative antipredation behaviours (grouping and use of cover) and survival.        2. Vigilance was significantly higher when individuals fed in smaller groups and in taller vegetation. In the covey period (in early winter when partridges are in flocks), vigilance and use of taller vegetation was significantly higher at sites with higher sparrowhawk predation risk, but tall vegetation was used less by larger groups. Individuals were constrained in reducing individual vigilance by group size and habitat choice because maximum group size was determined by overall density in the area during the covey period and by the formation of pairs at the end of the winter (pair period), when there was also a significant twofold increase in the use of tall cover.        3. Over the whole winter individual survival was higher in larger groups and was lower in the pair period. However, when controlling for group size, mean survival decreased as vigilance increased in the covey period. This result, along with vigilance being higher at sites with increasing with raptor risk, suggests individual vigilance increases arose to reduce short-term predation risk from raptors but led to long-term fitness decreases probably because high individual vigilance increased starvation risk or indicated longer exposure to predation. The effect of raptors on survival was less when there were large groups in open habitats, where individual partridges can probably both detect predators and feed efficiently.        4. Our study suggests that increasing partridge density and modifying habitat to remove the need for high individual vigilance may decrease partridge mortality. It demonstrates the general principle that antipredation behaviours may reduce fitness long-term via their effects on the starvation-predation risk trade-off, even though they decrease predation risk short-term, and that it may be ecological constraints, such as poor habitat (that lead to an antipredation behaviour compromising foraging), that cause mortality, rather than the proximate effect of an antipredation behaviour such as vigilance.

AB  - We measured predation on 120 artificial Sage Grouse (Centrarcus urophasianus) nests in montane sagebrush grassland in northern Utah. We examined nests in areas that had been chained and seeded 25 years previously (treated areas) and in areas that were untreated. Predation rates of artificial nests were higher in areas of untreated sagebrush, even though these areas had greater sagebrush cover, taller shrubs, and greater horizontal plant cover. These results differ from those previously hypothesized for treated sagebrush habitat and may reflect a greater abundance of other potential prey species, especially lagomorphs, in untreated areas that attracted greater densities of predators. In addition, over 80% of nests were depredated by mammals, which hunt using olfaction and are less likely than avian predators to be affected by nest cover. We conclude that, after treated sagebrush has recovered to some degree, predation rates of Sage Grouse nests may be lower in treated sagebrush. Consequently, factors other than nest predation (e.g., winter food, thermal cover, insects, perennial forb abundance) may be more important reasons for preserving mature sagebrush stands for Sage Grouse.

AB  - Brood survival is among the lease understood aspects of the population ecology of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). Individual-based brood survival estimators require uniquely marked chicks; however, no method has been developed to mark them. We evaluated efficacy of using patagial wing bands and passive integrated transponders (PITs) to mark 1-day-old captive northern bobwhite chicks. We compared survival, weekly mass gain, and mark retention among groups of chicks marked with patagial wing bands, PITs, and plastic and aluminum leg bands (control; n = 50/treatment). We detected no differences among marking methods in growth (P = 0.558) or survival to 12 weeks posthatch (P > 0.050). Of those birds that survived to 12 weeks posthatch, 2 birds (approx 5%) from each of the PIT and patagial band groups lost their marks. Tag destruction during simulated harvest did not differ between PIT-tagged and wing-banded groups (P = 0.126). In this captive experiment, both techniques had minimal effects on measured parameters and thus may be useful field-marking techniques. Because of our results, lower cost, and external visibility of patagial markers, we advocate use of patagial markers to tag bobwhite chicks for studies of chick survival, harvest rate, and site fidelity.

AB  - Greater sage-grouse (hereafter sage-grouse; Centrocercus urophasianus) populations have declined across their range. Increased nest predation as a result of anthropogenic land use is one mechanism proposed to explain these declines. However, sage-grouse contend with a diverse suite of nest predators that vary in functional traits (e.g., search tactics or hunting mode) and abundance. Consequently, generalizing about factors influencing nest fate is challenging. Identifying the explicit predator species responsible for nest predation events is, therefore, critical to understanding causal mechanisms linking land use to patterns of sage-grouse nest success. Cattle grazing is often assumed to adversely affect sage-grouse recruitment by reducing grass height (and hence cover), thereby facilitating nest detection by predators. However, recent evidence found little support for the hypothesized effect of grazing on nest fate at the pasture scale. Rather, nest success appears to be similar on pastures grazed at varying intensities. One possible explanation for the lack of observed effect involves a localized response by one or more nest predators. The presence of cattle may cause a temporary reduction in predator density and/or use within a pasture (the cattle avoidance hypothesis). The cattle avoidance hypothesis predicts a decreased probability of at least one sage-grouse nest predator predating sage-grouse nests in pastures with livestock relative to pastures without livestock present during the nesting season. To test the cattle avoidance hypothesis, we collected predator DNA from eggshells from predated nests and used genetic methods to identify the sage-grouse nest predator(s) responsible for the predation event. We evaluated the influence of habitat and grazing on predator-specific nest predation. We evaluated the efficacy of our genetic method by deploying artificial nests with trail cameras and compared the results of our genetic method to the species captured via trail camera. Our molecular methods identified at least one nest predator captured predating artificial nests via trail camera for 33 of 35 (94%) artificial nests. We detected nest predators via our molecular analysis at 76 of 114 (67%) predated sage-grouse nests. The primary predators detected at sage-grouse nests were coyotes (Canis latrans) and corvids (Corvidea). Grazing did not influence the probability of nest predation by either coyotes or corvids. Sagebrush canopy cover was negatively associated with the probability a coyote predated a nest, distance to water was positively associated with the probability a corvid predated a nest, and average minimum temperature was negatively associated with the probability that either a coyote or a corvid predated a nest. Our study provides a framework for implementing an effective, non-invasive method for identifying sage-grouse nest predators that can be used to better understand how management actions at local and regional scales may impact an important component of sage-grouse recruitment.

AB  - Detailed knowledge of demographic parameters (such as age structure and reproduction rates) is crucial for guiding conservation and management decisions regarding wildlife populations. Such parameters of wild ring-necked pheasant populations in the current agricultural landscape remain very poorly described. We researched age structure and reproduction rates of predominantly wild populations of the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) across the intensively managed agricultural landscape of the Czech Republic. The study area is influenced only marginally by hand-reared pheasants (i.e. as shown by comparison of the average number of released individuals in the study area: 0.3 male/yr/1km(2) and 0.9 female/yr/1km(2) and average number of released individuals and harvested in the study area: 8.6 male/yr/1km(2)) and there is a long-term huntable pheasant population. To determine the age of individuals, we used proximal primary feather shaft diameters of 1487 feather samples from males hunted between 2009 and 2011. Moreover, we evaluated the age structure of females as well as both sexes together based on the sex ratio and annual game census. We found a relatively high proportion of adults in the population in comparison with other studies. However, the number of adults decreased throughout the years: 2009 (male 44.7%; female 69.5%; male female 60.7%), 2010 (male 35.2%; female 61.3%; male female 51.5%), 2011 (male 29.8%; female 57.4%; male female 47.0%). The decrease of adults went hand in hand with increase of juveniles and reproduction rates of the study population: 2009 (male 124%; female 44%; male female 65%), 2010 (male 184%; female 63%; male female 94%), 2011 (male 236%; female 74%; male female 113%). Only males were hunted in the study area so we determined higher proportions of females in population for all years. This is the main reason why the reproduction rate of females was lower in percentage expression. Generally, our results showed lower productivity of pheasants in the Czech agricultural landscape in comparison with earlier published studies conducted in the US and UK. However, these studies were published many years ago and thus do not reflect the actual environmental conditions and changes which took place recently (i.e. agricultural intensification).

AB  - Forage quality is rarely the focus of studies on grouse performance. The plant stress hypothesis predicts that the protein digestibility of a focal food plant for grouse in Norway, the bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus should be highest after a peak in seed production. Protein digestibility may also be affected positively by cosmic ray (muon) fluxes, which fluctuate with the 9.3-year lunar nodal phase cycle, and negatively by high temperatures in the preceding summers. The annual change (first difference) in ln-transformed black grouse Tetrao tetrix and capercaillie T. urogallus hunting statistic indices from southern Norway 1999-2017 was positively related to the mean June temperature, which is assumed to have a direct positive impact on chick survival. In multiple regression models, there was also a positive relationship with the seed production of bilberry in the preceding year, the lunar nodal phase index with a two-year time lag, and a negative relationship with the combined mean June-September temperature of the two preceding years. Small rodent numbers did not contribute significantly in these models. In further monitoring of grouse populations, the seed production of bilberry or other important food plants should also be recorded.

AB  - Nearly rangewide declines in northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) abundance have led many conservationists to call for more restrictive hunting regulations. I used statewide quail harvest data collected by Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPW) biologists to evaluate how severely daily bag limits and season lengths would have to be restricted before total quail harvest would be reduced. I assumed that regulatory changes must consistently decrease the number of quail harvested before such changes could result in increased numbers of quail available to breed-a prerequisite for increased quail recruitment into the breeding population over the long term. Reducing the daily bag limit from 15 to 8 quail likely would impact only 11 and 7% of northern bobwhite and scaled quail hunters, respectively, during years of average quail abundance. Because some hunters harvest more quail per day than others, these same conditions Would be expected to decrease northern bobwhite and scaled quail harvest by approximately 27 and 15%, respectively. A 6-quail daily bag limit might reduce northern bobwhite and scaled quail harvest, respectively, by 52 and 35% during a quail "boom" year, yet by only 43 and 16% during a quail "bust" year. Therefore, reductions in daily bag limits are regressive because they restrict harvest most when restrictions are least needed, vet decrease harvest least when restrictions would be most beneficial. Because <10% of Texas quail hunters spend >12 days in the field annually. small reductions in the season length would not be expected to alter harvest. If 1 week during the hunting season actually represents 2 days of hunting (a weekend), a 6- or 4-week season might decrease the number of days 10 and 19% of hunters, respectively, spend in the field, which could decrease the total quail harvest. Because quail harvest becomes increasingly additive to other sources of mortality as the hunting season progresses, those promulgating hunting regulations might consider eliminating hunting late in the season. since the ratio of increased quail available to breed would he greatest during this period. It is likely, however, that the only way to reverse rangewide declines in quail abundance is to increase the quantity of space quail can use throughout the year. It is doubtful that more politically palatable approaches, such as minor regulatory changes, will be of value by themselves.

AB  - The contiguous grasslands of the Sandhills region in Nebraska, USA, provide habitat for two sympatric, grassland-obligate species of grouse, the greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) and the plains sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus jamesi). Collectively referred to as prairie grouse, these birds are monitored and managed jointly by wildlife practitioners who face the novel challenge of conserving historically allopatric species in shared range. We reconstructed region-wide and route-specific prairie grouse population trends in the Sandhills, using a 63-year timeseries of breeding ground counts aggregated from old reports and paper archives. Our objective was to repurpose historical data collected for harvest management to address questions pertinent to the conservation of prairie grouse, species whose populations have declined precipitously throughout their respective ranges. Because we cannot change the sampling protocol of historical data to answer new questions, we applied 3 different methods of data analysis-traditional regional mean counts used to adjust harvest regulations, spatially implicit, site-specific counts, and spatially explicit trends. Prairie-chicken populations have increased since the 1950s, whereas sharp-tailed grouse populations have remained stable or slightly declined. However, each species exhibited unique shifts in abundance and distribution over time, and regional indices masked important aspects of population change. Our findings indicate that legacy data have the capacity to tell new stories apart from the questions they were collected to answer. By integrating concepts from landscape ecology-a discipline that emerged decades after the collection of our count data began-we demonstrate the potential of historical data to address questions of modern-day conservation concern, using prairie grouse as a case study.

AB  - The mortality process is a key component of avian population dynamics, and understanding factors that affect mortality is central to grouse conservation. Populations of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus have declined across their range in western North America. We studied cause-specific mortality of radio-marked sage-grouse in Eureka County, Nevada, USA, during two seasons, nesting (2008-2012) and fall (2008-2010), when survival was known to be lower compared to other times of the year. We used known-fate and cumulative incidence function models to estimate weekly survival rates and cumulative risk of cause-specific mortalities, respectively. These methods allowed us to account for temporal variation in sample size and staggered entry of marked individuals into the sample to obtain robust estimates of survival and cause-specific mortality. We monitored 376 individual sage-grouse during the course of our study, and investigated 87 deaths. Predation was the major source of mortality, and accounted for 90% of all mortalities during our study. During the nesting season (1 April - 31 May), the cumulative risk of predation by raptors (0.10; 95% CI: 0.05-0.16) and mammals (0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-013) was relatively equal. In the fall (15 August - 31 October), the cumulative risk of mammal predation was greater (M-(mam) = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.04-0.19) than either predation by raptors (M-(rap) = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.00-0.10) or hunting harvest (M-(hunt) = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.0-0.06). During both seasons, we observed relatively few additional sources of mortality (e.g. collision) and observed no evidence of disease-related mortality (e.g. West Nile Virus). In general, we found little evidence for intraseasonal temporal variation in survival, suggesting that the nesting and fall seasons represent biologically meaningful time intervals with respect to sage-grouse survival.

AB  - The eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) is an economically important upland game bird that has been successfully reintroduced in Wisconsin, USA, and now occurs across the entire state. Although populations have become relatively stable across much of the state, recent concerns have been expressed regarding a plateau in total harvest and declines in local abundance across some areas. Current ecological and demographic parameters are needed to develop biologically justifiable and efficient management strategies. To address these concerns, we used demographic data collected during recent studies on wild turkey survival and productivity in 2 contrasting landscapes with differing proportions of forest and open cover. We then used the properties of deterministic matrix models to identify parameters predicted to have the greatest effect on the finite rate of population change () in both landscapes. Our analyses projected population decline for turkeys in predominately forested landscapes (=0.782) and population increases in more open landscapes (=1.112). Variance-scaled sensitivities suggested that was most sensitive to variation in nest and poult survival for populations in both landscapes. A life-table response experiment further indicated that higher in open landscapes was largely attributable to greater rates of yearling and adult female survival during the nesting and brood-rearing period. Simulated variations suggest manipulations in female harvest during the fall either-sex season had less impact on than did alterations in components of fecundity. Our model results indicated that wild turkey population growth varies across landscapes in southwest and west-central Wisconsin. Management practices that address factors influencing components of fecundity likely have the greatest effect on in both landscapes. Additionally, populations in forested landscapes may require more conservative harvests to enhance female survival if population stability or increase is to be realized.

AB  - The use of lead shotgun ammunition for hunting has been banned in a few jurisdictions and habitats, principally to protect wild birds from poisoning by ingestion of spent lead shot. The EU and UK REACH processes have recently considered bans on lead ammunition throughout the European Union and United Kingdom, including assessments of possible health benefits from reduced human dietary exposure to lead from game meat. Comparisons of the mean lead concentrations in meat from gamebirds killed using lead and non-lead shotgun ammunition have not been published. We compared lead concentrations in meat from wild -shot pheasants from which lead shotgun pellets were recovered (n = 27) with those from which iron pellets were recovered (n = 20), having removed all pellets from the meat before analysis. The mean concentration of lead in meat from pheasants killed using lead shot was 2.10 mg/kg w.w., which is >20 times the European Union's maximum permitted level for the lead concentration in meat from domesticated animals. For pheasants killed using iron shot the mean was 0.07 mg/kg w.w., which is below the maximum permitted level.

AB  - Since the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident, monitoring of tissues from hunted game animals ensures compliance with the standard food limits for radionuclides in Japan. We quantified the transfer of Cs-137 from contaminated land to game animals using the Aggregated transfer factor (T-ag = activity concentration in meat [Bq kg(-1) fw]/amount in soil [Bq m(-2)]) of Cs-137 for Asian black bear, wild boar, sika deer, green pheasant, copper pheasant and wild duck, collected between 2011 and 2015. Open data sources were used from Fukushima, Miyagi, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures. Our initially compiled data showed that the maximum reported Cs-137 activity concentration in wild boar after the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident were lower than those reported after the Chernobyl accident. The geometric mean T-ag values (m(2)kg(-1) fw) of Cs-137 in 2015 for Asian black bear, wild boar, sika deer and copper pheasant were similar (1.9-5.1) x 10(-3) while those for green pheasant and wild duck were about 1 order of magnitude lower at (1.0-2.2) x 10(-4). Effective half-lives were 1.2-6.9 y except for sika deer and copper pheasant where no decreases were found. In contrast to the Chernobyl accident, no seasonal change occurred in the meat Cs-137 activity concentrations of the wild animals during the study period.

AB  - Animal species across multiple taxa demonstrate multi-annual population cycles, which have long been of interest to ecologists. Correlated population cycles between species that do not share a predator-prey relationship are particularly intriguing and challenging to explain. We investigated annual population trends of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.) across Wyoming to explore the possibility of correlations between unrelated species, over multiple cycles, very large spatial areas, and relatively southern latitudes in terms of cycling species. We analyzed sage-grouse lek counts and annual hunter harvest indices from 1982 to 2007. We show that greater sage-grouse, currently listed as warranted but precluded under the US Endangered Species Act, and cottontails have highly correlated cycles (r = 0.77). We explore possible mechanistic hypotheses to explain the synchronous population cycles. Our research highlights the importance of control populations in both adaptive management and impact studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional value of these indices (lek counts and hunter harvest) for tracking broad-scale fluctuations in the species. This level of highly correlated long-term cycling has not previously been documented between two non-related species, over a long time-series, very large spatial scale, and within more southern latitudes.

AB  - A fundamental assumption of avian survival analysis is that the act of capture, handling, and marking birds does not affect subsequent survival. This assumption is violated when animals experience injury, physiological stress, or disorientation during capture and handling that increases their mortality risk following release. Such capture-related effects must be accounted for during analysis, typically by censoring individuals from the survival history, to avoid biasing the resulting survival estimates. We reviewed studies of radio-marked upland game birds to characterize researcher approaches for addressing short-term effects of capture on survival, and used data from a study of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) to illustrate an empirical approach for evaluating such effects and identifying time thresholds to censor individuals that die shortly following release. A majority of studies (65%) reported using some form of censoring for mortality that occurred within one to three weeks after release, although only 8% of studies reported an empirical approach to identify a threshold for censorship. We found that Ruffed Grouse mortality was greater from one to six days following release when compared with 7 to 30 days. This threshold, and the proportion of birds censored as a result of it, is consistent with a number of previous studies of radio-marked Ruffed Grouse. We also found that short-term mortality of Ruffed Grouse following release was reduced by checking traps twice each day and by adequately concealing traps. We recommend that future studies of radio-marked birds employ empirical methods for detecting postrelease mortality thresholds, which will allow for reduced bias while minimizing unnecessary censorship of birds that die for reasons unrelated to capture.

AB  - Context. In Spain, the release of farm-reared partridges to hunt is increasingly used, despite being thought to affect sustainability of wild stocks and to reduce the need of natural habitats for game.        Aims. To explore the market value as a possible incentive for current management, we evaluated within a segment of the red-legged partridge hunting market whether the use of farm-reared birds (as opposed to wild stock) or the naturalisation of landscapes are affecting the hunt market price.        Methods. We considered estates that sell individual hunting days and contacted buyers through advertisements. We gathered all advertisements for the 2010 season in four top hunting magazines and two websites, and conducted a telephone survey to record price and associated characteristics of hunts. We looked for relationships between price and the characteristics of sold hunts, using general linear models.        Key results. Hunts varied largely in price, but neither restocking nor naturalisation of the landscape explained price variation, at least within our sample of estates. The absence of price difference between wild or released partridges could be reflecting the current difficulty to distinguish both kinds of products in the market.        Conclusions. Market forces alone might not be promoting the public interest of the sustainable use of wild stocks versus industrial hunting based on farm-reared birds.        Implications. If promoting conservation and sustainable use of wild stocks is considered a major goal of official institutions in charge of biodiversity conservation and game management, they should promote reliable ways of identifying estates selling wild or restocked partridges, and they should also evaluate benefits and costs associated with hunting farm-reared birds relative to wild birds, so as to help internalise these costs and benefits if necessary. A study of the determinants of hunter demands would also help explain variation in supply and market prices.

AB  - In a previous study, we suggested that hyperpredation by shared predators on red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), once a parasite (rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD) had decimated populations of rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the primary prey for most of the Mediterranean predators, was a major force driving partridge population dynamics in Spain years ago (Molen et al., PLoS One 3:e2307, 2008). Recently, however, Blanco-Aguiar et al. (Eur J Wildl Res 58:433-439, 2012) have asserted that this conclusion is poorly evidence-based and can subsequently promote raptor persecution by hunters. In response to Blanco-Aguiar and colleagues, here we provide complementary insights that favour our earlier hypothesis. After explaining several key concepts of the hyperpredation process, we use additional data and analyses to show that (1) a synchronised regime shift (i.e. a step, abrupt change in population size) to significantly lower population levels in both the rabbit and partridge populations took place coinciding with the RHD outbreak; (2) rabbit and partridge population dynamics were highly synchronised after the RHD outbreak, but not before; (3) an enhanced spatial autocorrelation at all the spatial scales emerged after RHD for partridge populations; and (4) the main shared predators' diet patterns were consistent with the hypothesis of enhanced predation pressure as a plausible mechanism behind the observed partridge dynamics. We support the idea that hunting bag data may be useful to infer realistic population dynamics and the ecological mechanisms explaining them, provided that (1) they are corrected by the number of hunting licenses; (2) appropriate statistical tools are employed; and (3) methodological constraints are adequately taken into account. Finally, we argue that the opinion of Blanco-Aguiar and colleagues that our original results can lead to raptor persecution is a misinterpretation of our study. In this sense, we make an appeal for the importance of accurately differentiating between the ultimate (e.g. infectious diseases favoured by humans) and the proximate (e.g. enhanced predation pressure) causes of the decline in prey of economic interest (e.g. game species) in order to avoid unnecessary, unfounded or presumed conflicts with lobbies of conservation concern (e.g. hunters).

AB  - The success of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) restoration programs in the Midwest has led to dramatic increases in occupied range. Habitats with limited forest land, once thought unsuitable for wild turkey, now support densities that exceed 30 birds/km(2) of timber. Turkey population growth has resulted in the liberalization of harvest regulations with corresponding increases in hunter numbers and turkey harvest. As pressures on the wild turkey resource escalate, so does the need for an enhanced understanding of population dynamics.        We used radiotelemetry to investigate survival and reproduction of wild turkey hens from 1980 to 1989 in the mixed timber-agricultural region of north-central Missouri. We also used direct recovery rates of banded gobblers to examine spring harvest mortality. Radio-marked hens (n = 327) were monitored annually, greater than or equal to 5 times/week, to derive estimates of cause-specific mortality, seasonal survival, and reproductive parameters. Band numbers from tagged gobblers (n = 134) were recorded at mandatory turkey check stations to estimate harvest mortality.        Seasonal survival rates of hens were variable, with winter rates exhibiting the greatest range (0.625-1.00). Although daily survival rates did not differ among seasons (P = 0.142) according to analysis of variance, a model selection procedure indicated that seasons could not be combined. Cause-specific mortality varied among seasons within years, with predation being the major cause of mortality. Legal fall-harvest mortality averaged 4.4% of radio-marked hens. Illegal kill of hens during the spring gobbler season ranged from 0.0 to 30.0% and averaged 5.2%, exceeding legal fall harvest of hens in some years. During the first year after banding, 11.2% of adult gobblers were harvested during spring hunting season.        The nesting rate (measured as the proportion of hens attempting to nest) was consistent and high (greater than or equal to 0.9) across years; however, hen success and nest success showed significant annual variation. Hen success differed between adult and subadult hens as did the success of first nests. We observed no difference in the success of renests between age classes of hens. Most poult mortality occurred by 2-weeks posthatch; however, annual estimates varied among years. Poult mortality at 4-weeks posthatch ranged from 0.419 to 0.705. Across years, increasing poult mortality was associated (p = 0.75, P = 0.054) with the number of days in June that rainfall exceeded 2.54 cm.        We used a stochastic population model to examine the effects of simulated spring harvest on the age structure of males and the effects of fall harvest on population growth. Increasing levels of spring harvest resulted in a decreasing proportion of adult males in the spring population and in the harvest. At a 5% level of fall harvest, population size at year 40 increased in 72% of the simulations. When a 10% level of fall harvest was modeled, population size at year 40 decreased in all simulations. The model was sensitive to changes in hen survival, nest success, and poult mortality. Simulations were run for 40 years with an initial population size of 5,820. Decreases in poult mortality of 10 and 20% resulted in increases in average simulated population size at year 40 of 3,154 and 19,957% (32.54 and 200.57 fold), respectively. The variation we observed in wild turkey survival and reproduction and our population model outputs suggest that harvest strategies can affect population growth and age structure. Fall harvests have the greatest potential to affect population growth. We recommend that state-level estimates of harvest, hunting pressure, reproduction, and survival form the basis for developing and evaluating wild turkey harvest strategies in the Midwest. A conservative approach to spring and fall harvest regulations is recommended if sufficient data to model populations are not available.

AB  - Denmark implemented a total ban on the use of lead shot for hunting and clay target shooting in 1996. Compliance was not studied systematically until recently. However, sporadic police checks and individual studies indicated that compliance was far from complete in the early years after regulation. To assess current levels of compliance with Danish regulations, we purchased 730 carcasses of pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and a further 690 mallard gizzards were obtained from >14 shooting events distributed across >10 local authority districts throughout East and West Denmark in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 hunting seasons. All carcasses and gizzards were subject to radiography and those that contained shot were examined, pellets removed by dissection and identified to shot type. In all, 3589 pellets (intact or fragmented) were found in 1420 carcasses/gizzards, of which 799 pellets (some fragmented) were identified. Among the sample of pheasants with embedded shot (N = 447), 1.8% (in 2016) and 2.2% (in 2017) were lead shot. Among 148 mallards in 2017 with embedded shot, 3.1% had lead shot. None of the 2017 mallard gizzards had embedded lead shot. We conclude that Danish pheasant and mallard shooters mostly comply with the lead shot regulations. Steel was the most used non-lead alternative. The majority of ingested shot was non-lead, indicating that lead shot is not generally available to pheasant and mallard and suggesting compliance with regulations in recent years/decades. The study showed that the possibility to predict the metal composition of shot pellets from X-ray images alone was highly inaccurate, confirming the necessity of necropsy to determine shot type.

AB  - Food habits of Arctic Foxes in Svalbard were determined by examining 898 stomachs from trapped foxes, by recording prey remains outside dens and by observing feeding and hunting behaviour in the field.  Sixty percent of the stomachs contained food. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) was the most frequently encountered food item (41%) followed by Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) (30%) and sea birds/fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) (35%). Several other food items were found in the stomachs, supporting the general perception of the Arctic Fox as an opportunistic feeder and scavenger. The weights of different food items in stomachs generally reflected their frequency of occurrence. There were no differences in food habits between sexes, between juveniles and adults, or between seasons. Reindeer, ptarmigan, alcids, fulmars and geese were the most frequently found prey remains at dens. Prey remains from terrestrial species (Reindeer, ptarmigan) were recorded significantly more often at inland dens (>10 km from the coast) than at coastal dens. Remains from Reindeer calves (< 4 months old) were found at several dens, and one adult fox was observed killing a Reindeer calf. Arctic Foxes also preyed heavily on breeding geese. Barnacle Geese (Branta leucopsis) did not protect themselves as well as Pink-Foot Geese (Anser brachyrhynchus). Arctic Foxes in Svalbard are both skilled predators and scavengers, and they are typical opportunistic and generalistic feeders. Fluctuations in the mortality of Reindeer and in the density of ptarmigan may affect Arctic Fox numbers in Svalbard.

AB  - Hunting ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in Great Britain depends on released birds. Hunters believe that the flying ability of reared birds has declined in recent years and think it may be due to genetic changes in the game farm stocks. Thus, we evaluated 3 stocks of wild, mixed, and game farm pheasant strains that were reared under identical conditions. After release there were no differences (P > 0.05) in dispersal or return rates, but the lighter wild birds flew better (P < 0.05) than the heavier game farm birds; mixed stock were intermediate. Selective shooting of high flying birds as well as conditions within game farms where they are raised may contribute to the deterioration of flying quality. The effect of on flying ability was small compared with differences between wooded areas hunted. Therefore woodland management to improve the flying quality of the birds may be a more effective management technique than the release of lighter, wild strain birds.

AB  - According to the National Wild Turkey Federation, there has been a 450% increase in the number of licensed wild turkey hunters since 1973. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research articles focusing specifically on turkey hunting. Most human dimensions of wildlife research have focused on either deer or waterfowl hunting. In this study, dimensions of hunting quality, days afield, and harvest were examined among a sample of 739 Virginia fall turkey hunters. Quality of a hunting season, rather than a specific hunt, was examined. Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed five domains of attributes of a high-quality turkey-hunting season: wildlife interaction, education, being away, social interaction, and hunting skills. The domains of hunting quality revealed by the PCA are similar to domains found previously for spring turkey hunters as well as other types of hunters. Also examined were hunter perceptions of overall hunting quality, the number of days spent hunting turkeys during the fall season, and harvest success. For comparative purposes and agency needs, hunters were segmented into three categories based on days spent hunting: low frequency (1 to 2 days), medium frequency (3 to 4 days), and high frequency (>= 5 days). The influence of these variables to respondents' perceptions of overall quality was examined using a series of regression models. Variables found to be significant predictors of quality were wildlife interaction and harvest success. Hunters who killed a turkey reported a significantly higher quality season than those who did not kill a turkey.

AB  - New methods for determining annual trends in mild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations are desirable, especially when heavily hunted populations are managed with limited resources. Cost-effective in dices to population trends could result from an increased understanding of relations between environmental factors and reproductive success. We examined the influence of heating degree-days (HDD) and deviation from normal precipitation on the 25-day survival of eastern wild turkey poults (M. g. silvestris) in southcentral New York during 1991-93. The proportion of poults surviving to 25 days posthatch was associated negatively with mean HDD/day during the first week posthatch (P < 0.001) and associated negatively with mean deviation from normal daily precipitation during the second week posthatch (P = 0.08). Observed survival rates of poults within broods were not highly associated (r = 0.46, n = 26) with weather-based predictions of survival within broods, but observed and predicted estimates of annual poult survival were similar. This similarity suggested weather might be a good predictor of annual rates of poult survival.

AB  - The effect of lead (Pb) toxicity on bone mineralization was investigated in a wild population of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) inhabiting a farmland area contaminated with Pb-shot from recreational hunting activities in Albacete, a southeastern province of Spain. Femora from 40 specimens of red-legged partridge were analyzed for Pb by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS), and for bone composition by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The FTIR and DRX data of bone were analyzed in detail to determine possible alterations in bone mineral chemistry and crystallinity due to Pb toxicity. Results showed a marked decrease in the degree of mineralization as Pb concentrations in bone tissue increased while XRD analyses showed that the crystallinity of apatite crystals increased with the Pb load in bone. These load-dependent effects are indicative that Pb contamination altered bone remodeling by reducing new bone mineral formation and demonstrate that bone quality is a sensitive indicator of adverse effects on wild bird populations exposed to Pb pollution.

AB  - Grey partridge populations showed drastic decreasing numbers throughout Europe. Existing knowledge of the causes of decline and the effectiveness of conservation measures was reviewed. Population studies from the UK indicated three periods: a stable population before 1950, sharply decreasing numbers in 1950-1970 and a continued decline after 1970. Other European studies fitted into this picture, with a 10-year lag in each period. The onset of population decrease corresponded with a sharp decrease in chick survival mainly caused by reduced insect availability due to pesticide use. Several factors caused the continued decreasing numbers after 1970, such as decreased hatching success and an increased role of predation. Measures to restore partridge numbers should firstly focus on the main cause of population decline, that is, improve foraging conditions to increase chick survival rate. Next to creation of special partridge habitat, conventional agriculture offers good opportunities to improve foraging conditions. Only when an integrative approach is adopted may large-scale habitat improvements be realised to restore population level to the level before 1950.

AB  - The global biodiversity crisis is driven by habitat changes to meet escalating food demands and is particularly evident in Mediterranean Europe through agricultural intensification and rural abandonment. Commercial hunting of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) may benefit biodiversity where hunting estates manage for habitat quality. This approach, featuring food and water supplementation, legal predator control, and reduced hunting of European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), fosters favorable conditions for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. In a matrix of degraded terrestrial habitats, occasional large patches of natural habitat and better preserved traditional agricultural habitats can be seen as "conservation islands". We compared biodiversity and bird and mammal abundances in 10 commercial partridge hunting estates (treatment areas) with ten agriculture focused landscapes (controls) in central Spain. We detected 75 bird species, 63 in treatment and 52 in control areas. Transect surveys indicated higher bird species richness in treatment areas, alongside extended raptor sightings. Muscicapidae and Turdidae were more frequent in hunting estates, likely due to more natural habitat conditions. Additionally, wild rabbits were seven times more abundant in hunting estates, and the endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) was exclusively detected in these. Non-target species, including rabbits (45%) and birds (21%), were attracted to partridge feeders and waterers. Our findings suggest that commercial partridge hunting lands enhance biodiversity by preserving habitat and supporting prey, potentially acting as conservation islands with positive effects on biodiversity beyond their borders.

AB  - We derived consequences (realizations of hunter efficiency, relative harvest rates) of fixed, liberal quail (northern bobwhite [Colinus virginianus], Gambel's quail [Callipepla gambelii], and scaled quail [C. squamata]) harvest regulations applied at large scales from time series on quail abundance, total harvest, and hunter participation. Data came from Kansas (1966-2001), Missouri (1983-2001), Oklahoma (1990-2001), north and south Texas (1986-2001), and Arizona (1982-1999), USA, where harvest regulations were liberal (season length 2.5-4 months, daily bag limit 8-15 birds) during the periods of record. For all study regions, hunter-days were expressible as a linear function of quail abundance, and total harvest was expressible as a linear function of hunter-days. These results implied that hunter efficiency (harvest/hunter-day/index bird) declined monotonically and curvilinearly as quail populations increased. Likewise, relative harvest rate declined monotonically and curvilinearly as abundance increased, which implied that harvest was not self-limiting; however, the rate of decline generally was low because harvest rate was the product of an increasing (hunter-days) and a decreasing function (hunter efficiency) of quail abundance. Under fixed, liberal regulations, variations in quail abundance seem to govern harvest rates at the state or regional level; the regulations per se probably are biologically inconsequential.

AB  - The red-legged partridge is a small game species widely hunted in southern Spain. Its commercial use has important socioeconomic effects in rural areas where other agrarian uses are of marginal importance. The aims of the present work were to identify areas in Andalusia (southern Spain) where game yields for the red-legged partridge reach high values and to establish the environmental and land use factors that determine them. We analysed 32,134 annual hunting reports (HRs) produced by 6,049 game estates during the hunting seasons 1993/1994 to 2001/2002 to estimate the average hunting yields of red-legged partridge in each Andalusian municipality (n=771). We modelled the favourability for obtaining good hunting yields using stepwise logistic regression on a set of climatic, topographical, land use and vegetation variables that were available as digital coverages or tabular data applied to municipalities. Good hunting yields occur mainly in plain areas located in the Guadalquivir valley, at the bottom of Betic Range and in the Betic depressions. Favourable areas are related to highly mechanised, low-elevation areas mainly dedicated to intensive dry crops. The most favourable areas predicted by our model are mainly located in the Guadalquivir valley.

AB  - There is little knowledge of how disturbances affect the behavior and survival of pheasants in agricultural landscapes of the Midwest. Thus, we studied the survival of 81 female ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in Ford County, eastcentral Illinois, from 1989-94. Among the most intensively cropped regions of North America, the study area averaged 93% row crops (corn and soybeans, in equal proportion). We monitored the numbers of extended movements by hens associated with farm operations, hunting, weather, and other causes. The average number of extended movements observed per bird (3.5 +/- 0.4) was not different for adults and juveniles. Using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator of survival, the longevity of hens with more than the median number of extended movements was greater (330 +/- 37 days) than hens with less than the median number of extended movements (115 +/- 15 days). Hens exhibiting disturbance-avoidance behavior associated with extended movements coped relatively well with hazards, except during nesting. Our findings underscore the importance of movement as a survival mechanism in a hazardous landscape with marginally suitable habitat.

AB  - We analysed the crop contents of 94 Pyrenean Grey Partridges Perdix perdix hispaniensis collected in the eastern Pyrenees from 1980 to 1996. Birds were shot by hunters in September-November over a large range of altitudes (1000-2400 m). The various food items were classified into six categories (grasses, forbs, seeds, berries, tubers-bulbs and animal prey), dried in an oven and weighed. Preparations of epidermal cells were made to identify grasses and forbs.        Vegetable matter accounted for 79% of dry weight. Grasses and forbs, in spite of high frequencies of occurrence (respectively 72% and 84%), contributed least to total dry weight. Seeds and animal prey, mainly Orthoptera, were the most important autumn foods, comprising respectively 30% and 21% of the total dry weight. There was neither age-related nor altitude-related difference in the foods eaten, but the contribution of green matter was higher in late autumn (> 20.X) than in early autumn.        Seventy five plant species were identified. The identification of epidermal cells of grasses by microscopic analysis showed a high frequency of the following three species: Poa alpina, Festuca rubra and F. ovina. At least 29% (20/70) of vegetable species eaten by partridges were characteristic of pastures subjected to a high grazing pressure.        In terms of habitat selection, these features suggest that in late autumn Grey Partridges sought mainly areas intensively grazed by cattle. In the mountainous habitat of the Grey Partridge, like shrublands of broom (Cytisus purgans), the floristic diversity is generally poor. Thus, grazing could improve both the diversity of flora and the level of nitrogen content of vegetable foods.

AB  - Changes in agricultural practices have reshaped agricultural landscapes and triggered a drastic decline in spatial and temporal heterogeneity leading to changes in habitat quality and food resources for birds. However, the precise relationships between landscape changes, spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and habitat preferences in response to those changes remain poorly known. We investigated patterns of habitat selection and causes for changes over the years 1997-2017 for the gray partridge Perdix perdix, an iconic farmland species which has experienced a severe decline since the 1950s. Using a long-term (1997-2017) dataset collected over 435 km(2), we modeled relationships between annual land-cover maps and partridge sightings over 17 5-year moving windows, assessing the effects of landscape metrics, the strength of the relationships, and the dynamics of habitat suitability. We detected a shift in gray partridge habitat preferences over time, toward more risky habitats. Avoidance of predator reservoirs (woodlands and buildings) has weakened, and selection of human infrastructure, such as roads and tracks, has increased. Since 1997, the mean size of suitable patches has also decreased by about 26%. We have interpreted these changes in habitat selection as being the result of decreasing habitat quality and the increasing prevalence of captive-reared birds, currently released in their thousands in the study site. Synthesis and applications. The gray partridge has not adjusted well to changes in farming practices, and the low, still decreasing, population density suggests that it is not sustainable, despite local initiatives and the investment in captive-bird releases. We emphasize that efforts must be redirected toward habitat improvement to restore the density of refuge cover, insects, and seeds in the landscape, hunting management to ensure self-sustainable populations and massive releases of high-quality birds. Only integrated local management, involving hunters, farmers, gamekeepers, and scientists can ensure the recovery of this species.

AB  - Anthropogenic development impacts habitat use by many rangeland species including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Recent policies, including Wyoming's Sage-Grouse Executive Order, have been implemented to conserve habitat and populations of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Core Areas (CAs), designated for sage-grouse conservation by the Wyoming policy, are likely less disturbed than non-CA, predictably providing protection for nontarget species, such as mule deer, that share substantial habitat with sage-grouse. Our objectives focused on examining the influence of Wyoming's CAs on mule deer including 1) quantifying oil and gas development within crucial winter range and Hunt Areas (HAs) with respect to CA overlap and 2) using fawn-to-female ratios (fawns . 1 adult female(-1)) to evaluate whether deer populations overlapping CAs were more productive. We used oil and gas well data from the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and fawn-to-female ratios for 103 mule deer HAs derived from Wyoming Game and Fish Department data across designated mule deer crucial winter ranges (1980-2013) and statewide mule deer HAs (1995-2013). Numbers and trends in well pads were lower within CA-overlapped deer winter range than non-CA-overlapped winter ranges during 1980-2013. Mule deer HAs overlapped by CAs also displayed lower trends of well pads as the percentage of CA overlap increased. Trend in fawn-to-female ratios (mean = 0.69, range: 0.55-0.83) was higher in HAs with >= 70% CA overlap compared with a slight but significant negative trend in fawn-to-female ratios (mean - 0.64, range: 0.53-0.73) in HAs with no CA overlap (<= 1%) from 1995-2013. HAs with CA overlap >= 70% exceeded 0.66 fawns-to-female, a threshold indicative of an increasing population. The relative change in fawn-to-female ratios has important implications to conservation of mule deer populations. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The analysis of density fluctuations of key species is a crucial element for assessing how natural ecosystems respond to climate and environmental change. The black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) has experienced a constant population decline in the recent decades in Italy. We investigated whether meteorological variables and density dependence affected the growth rate of a black grouse population in the Orsiera-Rocciavre Park (Piedmont, Italy) in the western Alps from 1991-2009. Empirical models showed that population growth rates were negatively affected by rainfall during the brooding-hatching period (early Jun) and were positively influenced by the diurnal temperature variation during the snow-burrowing period (Dec). We then used the most parsimonious models derived from the data to project black grouse population estimates (2010-2050) based on published regional and global climate models. In most cases, the population remained rather stable or weakly decreased in future climate scenarios, both with and without the inclusion of density-dependent effects, but it displayed significant oscillations depending upon the vagaries of the climate. The influence of meteorological variables in regulating black grouse population dynamics indicated that management actions should consider the climatic conditions affecting the population. In particular, the conservation of breeding and wintering habitats should be promoted by limiting human disturbances and reducing hunting quotas in years with unfavorable weather conditions.

AB  - We estimated mortality specific to dispersal, nesting, and brood-rearing activities (15 Mar-15 Aug) for 118 female Rio Grande wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo Intermedia) in south-central Kansas from 2 February to 15 August 1991 (n = 40) and 8 January to 5 September 1992 (n = 78) to better understand the effect of these activities on survival during the reproductive season. Female survival from January through August was 54.7% (SE = 0.047) and survival during the reproductive season was 62.1% (SE = 0.047). Juvenile females dispersed (($) over bar x = 11.51 km) longer distances (P = 0.014) than adult females (($) over bar x = 6.16 km). We found no relationship between dispersal distance and survival for adults (P = 0.54) or juveniles (P = 0.15) during the reproductive season. Dispersal information could be used by managers as a guideline to establish management unit boundaries for harvest and habitat management activities. Survival (0.742) of females incubating first nests of the year was lower (P = 0.033) than survival (0.933) of females incubating second or third nests of the year. The influence of spring and early summer rains on vegetational communities may have been responsible for the higher survival probability of renesting females.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities, such as the translocation or introduction of animals, may cause a parallel movement of exotic parasites harboured by displaced animals. Although introduction and/or relocation of animals for hunting purposes is an increasingly common management technique, the effects of gamebird release as a major vehicle for the introduction of parasites into new geographic regions have rarely been reported. We examined the prevalence and distribution of avian malaria parasites infecting resident avian hosts (red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa) at a local scale, with a particular emphasis on the effects of releasing farm-reared birds for hunting on the spatial and temporal structure of the parasite community. We collected blood samples from adult partridges from two game estates with partridge releases and two sites without releases over two periods (spring and autumn). We tested the probability of infection and differences in the parasite community in relation to the management model (releases vs. non releases) and sampling period, comparing autumn (when farm-reared birds are released) and spring (after hunting season, when mostly wild birds can be found in the population). We found a high prevalence (54%) of Plasmodium spp., and substantial differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of parasite lineages among the populations studied. Some parasite lineages occurred at high frequencies in game estates without introduction of farm-reared partridges, while other lineages were more abundant in game estates with releases than in those without releases. Overall, the prevalence of avian malaria was similar between spring and autumn at non-release sites, whereas in sites with releases, it was higher in autumn than in spring-probably due to artificial restocking with infected farm-reared birds at the onset of the hunting season. In short, humans may be an important agent driving the alteration of the spatial structure of local parasite fauna via the introduction of exotic parasites by gamebird release, which could cause avian malaria outbreaks with severe repercussions for native avifauna.

AB  - Count data were collected from available studies on the European grey partridge (Perdix perdix) populations with at least 3 years of consecutive data. According to habitat characteristics, the period of study and the management practice the data were combined in two main subsets: the British populations from 1930 to the end of the 1960's and the "declining" continental populations from 1970 to the present. The latter populations are located in areas where the traditional landscape has been severely modified by important changes in agricultural practices. The goal of this work is: (a) to compare demographies of the two sets of populations; (b) to design and calibrate a stochastic demographic model on the basis of available data; (c) to use it to assess the risk of extinction under different management alternatives; (d) to test some of the most credited hypotheses on the grey partridge decline. Population dynamics are investigated via regression analyses of different factors on demographic rates. Spring-to-summer rate of increase and autumn to winter survival are shown to be density dependent in both UK and continental populations. Over-winter losses in UK prior to 1970 are positively correlated with the young-to-adult ratio, suggesting an important role of dispersal. Reproduction and survival rates were systematically larger in the traditional UK populations. Based on the regressions, stochastic demographic models were then built to assess the probability of extinction under various harvesting and management conditions, and the possibility of developing conservative hunting strategies. The stochastic modelling confirms that the UK populations prior to 1970 were intrinsically much more resilient than the continental populations in recent decades. Even very low rate of harvesting cannot be tolerated by the present continental populations, suggesting that the persistence of hunting activity, although with a limited effort, has probably contributed to the extinction of many sub-populations and is critically threatening the remaining ones. We show that the introduction of stochasticity into the model is fundamental for assessing the real extinction risk for partridge populations under different management scenarios. The comparison of UK and continental demographies does not provide evidence of a single main bottleneck for the continental populations, but the viability of continental populations is endangered by the concurrent deterioration of reproduction and survival rates.

AB  - Sown seeds are a key component of many farmland birds' diets due to natural food shortages in autumn and winter. Because these seeds are often treated with pesticides, their ingestion by birds can result in toxic effects. For risk assessment, data on treated seed toxicity should be combined with information about exposure risk for wild birds and the factors that modulate it. We characterized the exposure of red-legged partridges to pesticidetreated seeds through the analysis of digestive contents of birds shot by hunters (n = 194) in an agricultural region in central Spain. We measured the contribution of sown seeds to the partridges' diet and how it related to pesticide exposure. Moreover, we evaluated the influence of landscape composition on the intake of sown seeds and pesticides by partridges. During peak sowing time, seeds constituted half (50.7%) of the fresh biomass ingested by partridges, which consumed mostly winter cereal seeds (42.3% of biomass). Residues of seven fungicides and one insecticide (active ingredients) were detected in 33.0% of birds. The presence of pesticides in digestive contents was linked to the ingestion of cereal sown seeds. Moreover, dietary exposure of birds to pesticides was modulated by landscape characteristics, being lower in areas with heterogeneous landscapes, greater habitat mosaic and more natural vegetation. The estimated dietary intake of pesticides resulting from our field observations, in combination with experimental data on pesticide toxicity, raise concerns about the risks that pesticide-treated cereal seeds pose to granivorous bird populations. Our results highlight the importance of farming landscape composition and diversification, which should be considered as a priority in the agricultural policy to mitigate pesticide risks to farmland birds through the consumption of treated seeds.

AB  - We estimated total lead shotshell pellets expended, resultant pellet availability near soil surface, and the frequency of pellet ingestion by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) attributable to nearly a quarter century of bobwhite hunting on a 202-ha upland habitat at Tall Timbers Research Station, Leon County, Florida. A total of 7,776 shots were fired, resulting in the expenditure of approximately 4.5 million pellets (similar to 22,519/ha). Sixteen of 235 (6.8%) soil samples collected in 1989 and 1992 contained one or two pellets. Soil samples indicated that approximately 7,800 pellets/ha (about 35% of the projected 24-year deposition) were within 2.54 cm of the soil surface. Pellet ingestion by bobwhites was evaluated by examining 241 gizzards collected from 1989-92. Three bobwhites (1.3%) had ingested pellets (3 = 1.3 pellets). No instances of suspected lead poisoning were noted in bobwhites over the 24-year period. Sport hunting of wild bobwhite populations on upland habitats appears to produce a low potential for lead poisoning compared to lead deposition in association with waterfowl and dove hunting.

AB  - Behavioral adjustments are of critical importance for the survival of animals when exposed to risk and resource variations in their environment. Moving to safer habitats allows prey to reduce the risk of mortality triggered by predation. This response has been well studied at the population level to assist in identifying key habitat components for wildlife conservation. However, while individuals may differ in their response to risk and thus in their survival expectancy, the determinants of individual adjustments in space and habitat use are largely unknown in management and conservation studies. Using GPS monitoring, we investigated the relationship between individual traits (morphometry, personality, health status) and adjustments in the use of space relative to risky features (hedgerows, roads/tracks, woodlands, built-up areas) with regard to predation risk. We used the gray partridge (Perdix perdix) as a study model (captive-reared birds released into the farmlands). During the diel cycle, predation risk mainly occurs by carnivores at night, whereas human hunting pressure occurs during the day. We found that personality and health status had an effect on adjustments in the use of space as response to risky features. At night, when carnivore activity is expected to be high, bolder individuals were farther from hedgerows relative to the day. Similarly, individuals in good health were located farther from hedgerows, roads/tracks, and woodland at night relative to the day. We discuss the need for better consideration of individual traits in management and conservation programs, with a particular focus on recovery programs that rely on translocation of captive-reared individuals.

AB  - We studied the distribution and habitat-use of two endemic ground birds, the Bornean ground-cuckoo Carpococcyx radiatus and the Bornean peacock-pheasant Polyplectron schleiermacheri in the Sungai Wain Protection Forest, East Kalimantan. Both species are highly elusive and neither has been subject to any in-depth study. Consequently, few data are available on their population numbers, habitat preferences and conservation status. We mapped the species' presence in five topographical habitat types, assessed their spatial distribution, and provide an estimate of population sizes in the reserve. Over a period of 44 months (1997-2003) we had 32 encounters with Bornean ground-cuckoo, and 19 encounters with Bornean peacock-pheasant. Number of encounters increased over time, but no seasonal or monthly difference was apparent in encounter rate. Both species were only observed inside the central core of the reserve. Bornean ground-cuckoo showed a clear preference for alluvial and swamp forest over high-flat, slope and ridge forest. Bornean peacock-pheasant showed no clear preference for any of these five habitat types. Considering the rapid destruction of forest occurring in Kalimantan due to illegal logging, fires, lack of law enforcement and proper management of protected areas, the conservation of these two species is discussed in relation to conservation management of the Sungai Wain Protection Forest. Teams are patrolling year-round in the reserve to halt hunting. Illegal logging has been eradicated by these patrols, in combination with tree-spiking. Fire breaks are maintained each dry season to avoid further fire damage, and extensive education and awareness work is carried out in the district.

AB  - Counts of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) at leks have been used in harvest management, Endangered Species Act listing decisions, and land management policies for over half a century. Lek count sampling methods focus on counting male sage-grouse at known leks, primarily those observed visually from roads or vantage points, but leks are likely missed that are unknown prior to the survey and are difficult to detect while driving between known lek sites. One way to ameliorate this shortfall may be to conduct short point-count surveys at multiple stops along lek-survey routes or while driving between lek counts, thereby detecting newly established or unknown leks. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we estimated aural and visual detection probability of active sage-grouse leks during 1-minute point-count surveys at known distances and examined the effects of environmental factors on aural lek detection in southern Idaho, USA, 2016-2017. Our results demonstrate that field observers can aurally detect sage-grouse leks at approximately 3 times greater distances compared to detecting leks visually. The probability of hearing an active lek was highest near the peak of male and female attendance (8 Apr), within an hour of sunrise, on relatively calm and cold days, when the observer was at a higher elevation relative to the lek, and during conditions with no background noise. Detection probability declined with distance and the probability of aural detection was 0.59 at 1 km from a lek when other variables were held at their means. Hence, conducting >= 3 1-minute surveys along a lek route would be expected to detect >= 93% of all leks within 1.5 km of each survey under the average environmental conditions in our study. Our results suggest that surveys could greatly improve detection of unknown or newly established leks and can facilitate a more accurate assessment of sage-grouse population trends through lek counts. Moreover, our results demonstrate how environmental factors influence the detection of leks during surveys, and therefore which variables should be considered for inclusion in any future revisions of lek count protocols or in analyses of lek count data.

AB  - Survival and cause-specific mortality of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) hens were investigated in north Missouri during 1984-85. Survival estimates and distributions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method from a sample of 60 radio-marked hens. The annual survival rate was 0.435 .+-. 0.073. Predation and poaching were the major cause of mortality, acccounting for 54.9 and 38.7% of the losses, respectively. Legal fall harvest was responsible for only 3.2% of the deaths and was considered a minor cause of mortality. Seasonal losses were highest during spring. Forty-two percent of the illegal hen kills occurred during the spring gobbler season. Survival probabilities with poaching or predation as the only source of mortality followed similar patterns.

AB  - A questionnaire survey of land owners, managers and gamekeepers was conducted in order to assess the distribution of mountain hares in Scotland, assess their current management, collate numbers harvested in 2006-07 and estimate distribution change by comparing with similar data collected in 1995-96. The land area covered by returned questionnaires was 71098km2 (90% of Scotland). Mountain hares were reported as present on 34359km2 (48%) and absent from 36739km2 (52%). Mountain hare presence was strongly associated with heather moorland managed for red grouse shooting. Moorland managed for driven grouse shooting had the highest percentage area of mountain hare presence (median 64%) followed by moorland managed for walked-up grouse shooting (median 9%) and moorland with no grouse shooting (median 0%). Approximately 25000 mountain hares were harvested in 2006-07. Based on the estimated UK population in 1995 of 350000 (range +/- 50%), this represents around 7% of the population (range 5-14%). Reasons given by respondents for harvesting hares were tick control (50%), sport (40%) and forestry or crop protection (10%). Comparison of the estates surveyed in both 2006-07 and 1995-96 (a total area of 20462km2) indicated no net gain or loss in hare distribution. Furthermore, there was no evidence that levels of harvest had reduced the range of mountain hares in this area. It is not possible to comment on any distribution change outside this area (58737km2). Similarly, as no data were collected on abundance, it is not possible to draw conclusions on changes in density. Regular monitoring of mountain hare distribution within Scotland is required to identify any distribution changes. Measures of abundance throughout the range are necessary to estimate the population size, investigate the relationship between harvest intensity and changes in abundance and further assess the conservation status of this UK Biodiversity Action Plan species.

AB  - We studied diurnal habitat use and movements of 56 female ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) on private and public lands in southern Wisconsin [USA] from September through April 1968-71 using radio telemetry. Habitat use of female pheasants was a function of month, year, female age, and snow cover depth, but not female survival through April. Females preferred food patches and brush, and avoided pastures and active croplands in all 7 months. Shrub-carr wetlands were preferred by  females in all months except October, and marshes were preferred in all months except January and February. Retired croplands were preferred from October to December, but avoided in January. Upland hardwoods were avoided in most months except for periods of deep snow cover. Monthly home-range sizes averaged 32 ha. Home-range size during 10-day periods peaked in late October through early November, and declined to a low in early January through early February. Juveniles had larger ranges than  adults, and preyed-upon females had larger ranges than surviving females. Home-range size was positively related to corn harvesting and pheasant hunting pressure, and negatively related to snow cover depth. Females began a directional move (.hivin.x = 1,150 m) to winter cover in late September. Distance to winter cover was also a function of female age, female fate, corn harvest, and snow cover depth. Heavy hunting pressure appeared to temporarily suppress the use of food patches and strip cover, and accelerate the final move to winter cover, but did not cause females to move off public lands. Females remained in winter cover from early November through early February, using a variety of areas and habitats. The abundance of wetland cover in winter may have been responsible for a lack of winter concentration and independent moves betweens adults and juveniles.

AB  - In New York, Bonasa umbellus (Ruffed Grouse) abundance has declined since the 1960s, presumably due to forest maturation. Wildlife managers expressed concern that hunting may contribute to the population decline as habitat quality decreases. We monitored fall-winter survival of 169 radio-marked Ruffed Grouse at 2 study areas in New York differing in forest age and composition. Fewer than 11% of radio-marked birds were harvested, and seasonal survival was similar at the 2 study areas in both study years (0.38 and 0.51, 2007-2008; 0.48 and 0.48, 2008-2009). Predation, particularly by raptors, was the largest source of mortality, but locations of predation events were not associated with forest age or configuration within 300 m. We found no evidence to support a reduction in harvest limits, although our harvest estimates may have been biased low.

AB  - European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) are main small game species of conservation concern in Mediterranean ecosystems. To date, their presence in wild boar's (Sus scrofa) diet and factors driving their consumption have been little investigated. A genetic metabarcoding approach was used on 80 wild boar faeces collected from four hunting estates devoted to small game hunting during two different seasons. Abundances of wild boar, rabbits and partridges were first estimated. Results showed DNA of seventeen chordate species. The highest frequency of occurrence (FO) corresponded to mammals and birds, with 77.6 and 22.3%, respectively. DNA of game species was detected in 39/71 (FO = 55.0%) samples, highlighting the presence of European wild rabbit in 27 (FO = 38.0%) and red-legged partridge in eight (FO = 11.3%). Dietary composition varied between seasons and estates, being rabbit the main responsible (explaining 35.26% and 39.45% of differences, respectively). Rabbit FO in the diet was positively related to the abundance of wild boar and rabbit density on the estate. It was greater in autumn and in estates where rabbits were hunted. Regarding red-legged partridge, a significant and positive relationship between its population density and its diet FO was observed, without significant differences between seasons or estates. Overall, our results suggest wild boar as an opportunistic species whose diet is largely determined by the relative availability of different food resources. Its ecological role concerning small game species in Mediterranean agroecosystems seems to be more related to consumption of carrion during the hunting season than to direct predation.

AB  - To determine the diverse motivations of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) hunters, a self-administered questionnaire was developed and mailed to a sample of 5,000 licensed turkey hunters in Tennessee (response rate = 36%). A cluster analysis yielded three types of respondents in terms of their hunting motivations: social harvesters (44%), experiential harvesters (22%), and social outdoor enthusiasts (34%). Hunters in these segments were then analyzed to compare their support for various hunting regulations. While 61% of Tennessee eastern wild turkey hunters reported to be satisfied with current regulations, harvest-motivated hunters were less receptive to regulations that would limit season lengths or bag limits while socially motivated hunters were more accepting. The hunter groups did not differ in their preference for decentralizing regulations by management zones. Findings from this article may guide wildlife managers in designing socially acceptable regulations.

AB  - Natural forests likely will be unable to fulfill society's needs sustainably for wood fiber in the near future. In an attempt to meet increasing demands while protecting intact forests, producers have increasingly considered alternative sources of timber, such as intensively managed plantations. In regions that are economically dependent on forest harvesting, abandoned farm fields are often targeted for conversion to intensive coniferous plantations. These sites are generally in an early successional stage that is dominated by deciduous stands, which provide an important habitat type for several game species, including ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus). Therefore, conversion could represent a loss of habitat for this species and several others that are associated with early successional deciduous stages. We conducted grouse drumming surveys in northwestern Quebec, Canada to evaluate the effects of transforming old fields into conifer plantations on ruffed grouse by comparing densities between two habitat types: abandoned farm fields (n = 22) and old fields converted to conifer plantations (n = 19). To correct any audibility bias between habitat types, we located all drumming males that were heard at each site. We then analyzed the number of individuals that were detected in the sites with repeated count models. Our results show that overall drumming males avoided plantations. Overhead cover increased drumming male densities in both habitat types, whereas lateral cover increased drumming grouse densities only in plantations. The density of deciduous stems and fruit-bearing stems also had a tendency to increase drumming male densities, but their effects were marginal. Most ruffed grouse in abandoned farm fields used piles of woody debris on the ground as drumming structures rather than large logs or rock outcrops. Our results suggest that plantations do not have the vegetative cover and quantity of food stems necessary to support high ruffed grouse densities during the drumming season and that conversion of abandoned farm fields to coniferous plantations may exert negative cascading effects for reproduction and population growth.

AB  - Cheer pheasant is a globally vulnerable species mainly found in the mid-montane grassland of the western Himalayas. Such grasslands are spread sporadically, and the distribution of this species too, as a result, has remained patchy. Using Maxent, we investigated the distribution of cheer across its global range (Pakistan, India, and Nepal) to determine a potential distribution range. The model predicted that higher altitude (increasing probability peaking at 2060 m) and land cover categories of needleleaf evergreen forests, grasslands, barren and stony terrain, and croplands were the likely predictors of cheer pheasant occurrence. The model predicted a total potential distribution range of 3137.9 km(2), most of which lies in India. Interestingly, most areas within this range fall outside the protected areas network and are thus unprotected. The habitat of cheer is believed to require some form of continual disturbance, either naturally or by human intervention, to remain suitable for the species. Given the fact that most of its habitat lies outside the protected areas and the species tolerates limited amount of disturbance to its habitat, the future of the cheer is likely to be in the outside protected areas, provided that extremes of habitat change are limited and hunting is curtailed.

AB  - 1. Due to reductions in winter food resources, newly sown cereal seeds have become a key component of many bird species' diets, but these seeds are often treated with pesticides that may cause toxic effects. To complete an appropriate risk assessment, data on treated seed toxicity need to be combined with information about the risk of exposure of birds in the field and the factors that modulate such exposure.        2. We studied the abundance of pesticide-treated seeds available for birds in the field, the pesticides and their concentrations in treated seeds, and the bird species observed in the field that were feeding on these pesticide-treated seeds. The exposure of red-legged partridge to treated winter cereal seeds was characterized through the analysis of crop and gizzard contents of hunted individuals (a 189). Moreover, we measured the contribution of cereal seeds in the autumn winter diet of partridges in order to assess the potential risk of exposure to pesticide-treated seeds.        3. Density of treated seeds on the soil surface after sowing (11.3 +/- 1.2 seeds m(-2) in the centre of field and 43.4 +/- 5.5 seeds m(-2) in the headlands) was enough to provide, in an area between 6 and 50 m(2), doses of six active ingredients above those indicating acute (i.e. a dose capable of killing 50% of individuals of a sensitive species) and / or chronic (no observed effect level) toxicity.        4. Up to 30 bird species were observed consuming treated cereal seeds in recently sown fields. Corn bunting was identified as an appropriate focal passerine species for the risk assessment of pesticide-treated seeds.        5. We found that treated seeds were an important route of pesticide ingestion for red-legged partridge; pesticide residues (six fungicides and two insecticides) were found in 32.3% of crops and gizzards. Cereal seeds represented more than half (53.4 +/- 4.3%) of total biomass consumed by partridges from October to February.        6. Synthesis and applications. The field exposure data combined with previous studies about the toxicity to partridges of using pesticide-treated seeds point to an unacceptable risk of this practice to farmland birds. Our results suggest that the prophylactic use of pesticide-coated seeds should be avoided, with the approval of this treatment considered on a case-by-case basis and accompanied with specific measures to minimize risks of adverse effects on avian communities.

AB  - Little quantitative information is available to nonindustrial-private forest (NIPF) owners regarding economic tradeoffs between managing pine plantations for timber production or wildlife habitat. We modeled loblolly (Pinus taeda) pine plantations to quantify economic tradeoffs for competing management scenarios using densities aimed at wildlife habitat or timber production in the Lower Coastal Plain and Coastal Flatwoods regions of Mississippi, USA. Scenarios contained a range of site indices, planting densities, thinning densities and frequencies, and rotation lengths for timber maximization and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) or northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) habitat production. Land expectation values (LEVs) were highest for timber scenarios, followed by joint deer and timber, joint quail and timber, deer, and quail management scenarios. Comparison to the regional hunting lease rate revealed that compensatory lease rates from the study could be realized, making wildlife management as valuable as timber management. The results of this study could help landowners be more informed about economic tradeoffs when making management decisions on their property. (C) 2017 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - We studied 1964-1983 population dynamics of three species of tetraonids, capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) in Finland. The data comprise species-specific quantitative estimates of bird numbers in 11 provinces during the 20-yr period. Autocorrelation functions calculated from the trend-corrected data suggest that the population fluctuations are cyclic in all three species, cycles most frequently displaying six-yr periodicity. A model acknowledging long-term trend and incorporating linear combination of sine and cosine transforms of time mimics the fluctuations reasonably well. The coefficients of determination ranged from 25% to 88% depending on species and province. Fitting the same model to 1897-1930 hunting statistics of black grouse from south-western Finland indicates that such a clockwork-like dynamics has been licking at least from the beginning of this century. An analysis of variance of the lengths of increase and decrease phases of the population cycles further confirm the symmetric regularity of the tetraonid dynamics. No differences were found among species or provinces. A theoretical analysis, based on projection matrix techniques, shows that it is unlikely that such a regular cyclicity could be driven solely by intrinsic components of the population structure. The domain of other possible factors responsible for the clockwork-like dynamics is explored.

AB  - An epizootic of sarcoptic mange was prevalent among Scandinavian red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) during the late 1970s and 1980s. By substantially reducing the population density of foxes, the epizootic created a natural experiment on the importance of fox predation for prey density. The fox population started to recover during the late 1980s. We monitored the populations of the fox and its prey [voles (Cricetidae), mountain hare (Lepus timidus), European hare (L. europaeus), Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Black Grouse (T. tetrix), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)] throughout the event, on a local (10(1)-10(2) km(2)), a regional (10(4) km(2)), and a national scale. Methods included den counts, snap-trapping, pellet/dropping counts, counts of displaying birds, young/adult ratio from incidental observations of deer, regional questionnaires, and national hunting records. The study revealed red fox predation as a crucial factor in limiting the numbers of hares and grouse as well as fawns per doe of roe deer in autumn, and in conveying the 3-4 yr cyclic fluctuation pattern of voles to small game. The classical view, that predators take but a ''doomed surplus'' of their prey, was false for these species in Scandinavia.

AB  - Small-game hunting is of great economic importance in Portugal. Game managers claim that game management restrictions regarding shoots inside the Nature 2000 Network negatively influence small-game bags, particularly of hare, wild rabbit and red-legged partridge. We analyse whether different habitat and game management practices are associated with game bags of those species in Alentejo (Portugal). Game bag records from five hunting seasons referring to shoots both inside and outside Nature 2000 sites were analysed. Significant differences concerning habitat and game management descriptors were found between shoots inside and outside Nature 2000 sites. However, this ecological network does not seem to correlate with hare and red-legged partridge game bags, whilst it may negatively influence wild rabbit hunting results. Considering that habitat quality for wild rabbit is rather poor inside the studied Nature 2000 sites, further investigation is needed of the possible negative influence of this ecological network on the species' game bag. Hare game bags increase with extensive non-irrigated agricultural fields and orchards. Besides these two habitats, red-legged partridge game bags are also favoured by cork oak montado where predators are controlled. The game bags of the three small-game species studied increase with hunting effort. Further, our results suggest that there is a positive relation between hunting effort and small-game population abundance.

AB  - A number of wildlife species including the grey partridge (Perdix perdix) have shown dramatic post-war population declines. Multiple drivers have been proposed as reasons for the declines, for example agrochemical use and intensification of agricultural practices, climate, predation, and changes in landscape structure. These drivers may interact in non-linear ways and are inherently spatio-temporal in nature. Therefore models used to investigate mechanisms should be spatio-temporal, of proper scale, and have a high degree of biological realism. Here we describe the development and testing of an agent-based model (ABM) of grey partridge using a well documented pre-decline historical data set in conjunction with a pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach. Model development was an iterative process of defining performance criteria, testing model behaviour, and reformulating as necessary to emulate system properties whilst ensuring that internal mechanisms were biologically realistic. The model was documented using ODdox, a new protocol for describing large agent-based models. Parameter fitting in the model was achieved to within +/- 2% accuracy for 15 out of 17 field data patterns used, and within 5% for the remaining two. Tests of interactions between input parameters showed that 62% of parameter pairs tested had significant interactions underlining the complex nature of the model structure. Sensitivity analysis identified chick mortality as being the most sensitive factor, followed by adult losses to hunting and adult overwinter mortality, agreeing in general with previous partridge models. However, the ABM used here could separate individual drivers, providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind population regulation, and allowing factors to be compared directly. The ABM used is rich in output signals allowing detailed testing and refinement of the model. This approach is particularly suited to systems such as the partridge system where data for comparison to model outputs is readily available. Despite the accurate fit between historical data and model output, making use of the predictive power of the approach the model requires further calibration and testing under modern field conditions.

AB  - Grassland birds have declined more than any other guild in the United States because of loss and degradation of native grasslands. The United States Department of Agriculture Farm Bill programs have restored some native warm-season grasses (NWSG), but populations of many grassland bird species continue to decline. Market-based NWSG uses focused on hay, pasture, and biofuel feedstock may be more appealing to landowners, and may still provide grassland bird habitat on the landscape. We examined breeding grassland bird occupancy of 102 NWSG production fields including 5 treatments (control [n=37], grazing [n=7], hay [n=22], seed [n=21], and biofuel [n=15] production) in Kentucky and Tennessee during 2009-2010 breeding seasons. We used a robust design model in Program MARK to determine occupancy and detection rates for grassland birds. We modeled occupancy differences among treatments and sites (i.e., KY, TN), and included covariates (i.e., field-level vegetation metrics and landscape composition at 3 scales [250m, 500m, and 1km]) for eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). Covariates that influenced occupancy included treatment (field sparrow, 2009 only), site (eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, and northern bobwhite), percent NWSG cover (positive, red-winged blackbird), and percent forest cover within 250m (negative for eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, northern bobwhite, and red-winged blackbird) or within 1km (negative, field sparrow). Our results suggest that forest cover in the surrounding landscape negatively influences species occupancy, and species occupancy generally did not differ among NWSG production treatments. These treatments could be an alternative means to provide grassland bird habitat within an agriculture production landscape. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Roosting is an important component of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo; turkey) ecology as roosts provide security from predators and inclement weather. Males call (gobble) from roosts during the reproductive season, and roost locations are important for maximizing access to females and transmission of calls across the landscape, while also minimizing predation risk. Spring hunting of male turkeys occurs during the reproductive season, and hunting activity influences male behaviors and calling. Because roost sites are important for wild turkey ecology, we evaluated roost site selection and fidelity of male turkeys relative to land cover types, vegetative characteristics, and the presence of hunting activity during 2017-2018 in Georgia, USA. Prior to onset of hunting, males selected roosts nearest to hardwood and pine (Pinus spp.) forests. Roost site fidelity was low and distances between roosts were large. After onset of hunting, males selected pine forests less and exhibited greater plasticity in roost selection while fidelity remained minimal, suggesting that males may have altered selection to mitigate risk from hunting while maintaining the strategy of moving about their ranges and roosting at different sites on consecutive nights. Future research should examine potential effects of hunting-induced shifts in resource selection on other aspects of male turkey behavior and ecology. (c) 2019 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Examination of the endocrine system through non-invasive fecal sampling may improve population management more than using demographic indicators alone. By addressing the physiological mechanisms that are influencing fitness, management actions can be proactively developed to alleviate stressors. Proactive determination of vulnerable populations is critical for species of concern, such as the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), which have suffered decades of population decline. We validated an assay to noninvasively measure the adrenocortical response of captive reared bobwhite through fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM). All individuals received three sequential 48-hour treatments in which samples were collected every 4 hours, including a reference period, an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge and a biological stressor (exposure to a hunting dog). Reference FCM values had a mean concentration of 16.75 pg/mg (95% CrI: 13.68, 19.91) with adrenocortical activity increasing by 73% for the duration of the ACTH challenge (29.00 pg/mg; CrI: 25.01, 33.78). FCM concentrations remained similar to that of the reference levels during the biological stressor (16.56 pg/mg; CrI: 13.33, 19.92). Our study validates the use of feces to detect changes in FCM levels in our subject species but also demonstrates the complexity of FCM and the importance of both physiological and biological validation prior to field implementation.

AB  - We estimated survival rates of 135 female greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) on 3 study areas in southeastern Oregon, USA during autumn and winter for 3 years. We used known-fate models in Program MARK to test for differences among study areas and years, investigate the potential influence of weather, and compute estimates of overwinter survival. We found no evidence for differences in survival rates among study areas, which was contrary to our original hypothesis. There also were no declines in survival rates during fall-winter, but survival rates varied among years and time within years. Average survival rate from October through February was 0.456 (SE = 0.062). The coefficient of variation for this estimate was 13.6% indicating good precision in our estimates of survival. We found strong evidence for an effect of weather (i.e., mean daily min. temp, extreme min. temp, snow depth) on bi-weekly survival rates of sage-grouse for 2 of the study areas in one year. Extremely low (<- 15 degrees C) temperatures over an 8-week period and accumulation of snow had a negative effect on survival rates during the winter of 1990-1991 on the 2 study areas at the higher (> 1,500 m) elevations. In contrast, we found no evidence for an influence of weather on the low-elevation study area or during the winters of 1989-1990 and 1991-1992. Extreme weather during winter can cause lower survival of adult female sage-grouse, so managers should be aware of these potential effects and reduce harvest rates accordingly.

AB  - Reproductive success is a critical component of individual fitness, and also an important determinant of growth rates of populations characterized by early maturity and high fecundity. We used radiotelemetry data collected during 2003-2008 to estimate reproductive parameters in a declining northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) population in South Florida, and to test hypotheses regarding factors influencing these parameters. The overall clutch size was 12.10 +/- 0.22, but females laid more eggs in their first clutch (12.43 +/- 0.24) than in subsequent clutches (10.19 +/- 0.53) within a nesting season. Daily nest survival was higher for first (0.966 +/- 0.003) than subsequent nests (0.936 +/- 0.011). Hatchability (proportion of laid eggs that hatched conditional upon nest survival to hatching) was 0.853 +/- 0.008, but was higher for nests incubated by females (0.873 +/- 0.009) than those incubated by males (0.798 +/- 0.018). The proportion of individuals attempting a second nest was 0.112 +/- 0.024 and 0.281 +/- 0.040 when the first nest was successful and failed, respectively. Hatchability was lower when the nesting habitat was burned the previous winter. We found no evidence that food strip density (a management practice to provide supplemental food) influenced any of the reproductive parameters. Mean summer temperature affected hatchability, nest survival, and proportion of nests incubated by males. Overall, the reproductive output in our study population was lower than that reported for most other bobwhite populations, indicating that low reproductive performance may have contributed to bobwhite population declines in our study site. These results suggest that current management practices, particularly those related to habitat and harvest management, need careful evaluation.

AB  - 1. Human-wildlife conflict is an emerging issue in global conservation. The expansion of human activities throughout the world, combined with restoration of wildlife populations, has led to increased contact and greater conflict between people and wildlife.        2. The mitigation of human-wildlife conflict requires ecological research, social research, and dialogue between scientists, stakeholders and policy-makers to guide management. However, conflict mitigation may be politically sensitive, particularly when legal issues are involved and human livelihoods are at stake. In such cases, political pressures may override scientific evidence.        3. Conflicts over predator management are particularly revealing about the roles of science and politics in the mitigation of human-wildlife conflict. We focus in detail on one well-studied conflict between raptor conservation and grouse management in the UK. Research has demonstrated: (i) there is widespread illegal killing of raptors; (ii) raptor predation can limit grouse populations and reduce hunting revenues; and (iii) mitigation techniques are available but are either unacceptable to stakeholders or unproven in the field.        4. Despite the scientific advances, mitigation of this conflict has been slow. We explore the scientific, political and social barriers to finding a sustainable solution. We suggest that the entrenched positions of stakeholders are the main barrier to progress. We propose a way forward that, if successful, would lead to a win-win situation for raptor conservation and grouse management.        5. Synthesis and applications. The mitigation of human-wildlife conflict requires evidence-based management. Scientific evidence is insufficient, however, if the political will is lacking to find solutions. Mitigation of the conflict between raptors and grouse requires both natural and social science research and the recognition that compromises are required to achieve sustainable solutions. These lessons apply equally to human-wildlife conflict situations elsewhere.

AB  - The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is one of the most endangered felids in the world, and a high proportion of its populations occur in hunting grounds managed for red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) and wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), both game species of high socio-economic value and the latter a key prey species for the lynx. In this case study from south-eastern Portugal, we evaluated the game management practices, the abundance of partridges and rabbits (expressed as Kilometric Abundance Index), and the occurrence of mesocarnivores in four hunting grounds, two with and two without breeding lynx. In all grounds game management was conducted but in those where lynx occurred, full-time gamekeepers were employed and hunting was the major source of income. The results showed that grounds with breeding lynx had higher KAI values for partridges and rabbits, together with reduced mesocarnivores occurrence (particularly red fox Vulpes vulpes and stone marten Martes foina), compared to those without breeding lynx. Our results confirm that lynx occurrence fits within the management traits of those hunting grounds in Iberia aiming to increase partridges and rabbits for sustainable hunting, as they act as 'natural' gamekeepers. This could be considered as a 'win-win' situation; successful for lynx's establishment and small game conservation.

AB  - The likelihood of encountering a predator influences prey behavior and spatial distribution such that non-consumptive effects can outweigh the influence of direct predation. Prey species are thought to filter information on perceived predator encounter rates in physical landscapes into a landscape of fear defined by spatially explicit heterogeneity in predation risk. The presence of multiple predators using different hunting strategies further complicates navigation through a landscape of fear and potentially exposes prey to greater risk of predation. The juxtaposition of land cover types likely influences overlap in occurrence of different predators, suggesting that attributes of a landscape of fear result from complexity in the physical landscape. Woody encroachment in grasslands furnishes an example of increasing complexity with the potential to influence predator distributions. We examined the role of vegetation structure on the distribution of two avian predators, Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus), and the vulnerability of a frequent prey species of those predators, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We mapped occurrences of the raptors and kill locations of Northern Bobwhite to examine spatial vulnerability patterns in relation to landscape complexity. We use an offset model to examine spatially explicit habitat use patterns of these predators in the Southern Great Plains of the United States, and monitored vulnerability patterns of their prey species based on kill locations collected during radio telemetry monitoring. Both predator density and predation-specific mortality of Northern Bobwhite increased with vegetation complexity generated by fine-scale interspersion of grassland and woodland. Predation pressure was lower in more homogeneous landscapes where overlap of the two predators was less frequent. Predator overlap created areas of high risk for Northern Bobwhite amounting to 32% of the land area where landscape complexity was high and 7% where complexity was lower. Our study emphasizes the need to evaluate the role of landscape structure on predation dynamics and reveals another threat from woody encroachment in grasslands.

AB  - Meleagris gallopavo L. (Wild Turkey) is a valued game species that is sensitive to the timing of hunting seasons, which generally overlap with breeding, but can vary spatially or temporally. Here, we analyze the timing of turkey reproduction across North Carolina by examining camera-trap images collected from 527 sites over 3 years. We found a peak of male strutting behavior at Julian week 13 and, based on the age of poults photographed later in the summer, estimated the peak of egg hatching at week 22. The timing of strutting significantly varied across years but not across the 3 ecoregions of the state. Understanding turkey breeding and reproductive chronology can be useful when agencies set hunting seasons to balance the interest of hunters while minimizing potential impacts to reproduction.

AB  - Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations fluctuate widely in density, which may be due to changing nutritional conditions. High requirements for protein in the diet of bobwhites for reproduction and growth and the low quality of protein in many cereal grains led us to hypothesize that dietary limitations in certain essential amino acids may occur in wild bobwhite populations in western Oklahoma. We explored this hypothesis by examining seasonal changes in the amino acid composition of bobwhite diets and comparing observed levels in their diets to known requirements of a closely related species, Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Bobwhites were harvested seasonally (summer, autumn, winter 1989-1990) on three ranches from supplementally fed (<250 m from a food plot or feeder) and reference populations (>900 m from supplemental food). Bobwhites used supplemental food for >15% of their diet in only 1 of 6 seasons. Supplemental food did not appreciably influence body condition indices (body mass, organ masses, carcass composition), but did influence the diets of bobwhites, as evidenced by significant differences in concentrations of fat and essential amino acids in crop digesta. Although crude protein requirements apparently were met in all seasons, levels of greater-than-or-equal-to one essential amino acid in diets of reference and supplemented bobwhites were below recommended levels for growth or breeding in Japanese quail. The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine + cystine, were consistently the most limiting nutrients in the diet, with seasonal means ranging from 0-53% below recommended levels for growth or breeding in Japanese quail. These observations support our hypothesis that selected essential amino acids may be seasonally limiting in diets of bobwhites. Dietary requirements of bobwhite for suspected limiting amino acids should be determined in feeding trials to identify more accurately the magnitude of these apparent deficiencies.

AB  - European agricultural landscapes hold important endangered and game species, which may add socioeconomical and ecological value to the ecosystem, and thus must be considered priority species in any management programme integrating agriculture, hunting and conservation. Patterns of red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) nesting habitat selection and nesting success provide information for the implementation of these kinds of programmes in agrarian pseudosteppes. Nests occur mainly in cereal grain fields, although this habitat type was overall negatively selected and had the lowest nesting success. Only lindes (herbaceous strips among fields) were positively selected, and were also the habitat type with the highest nesting success. Nests within cereal grain fields were positively selected close to the field margins (mostly < 5 m). Agricultural practices, particularly harvesting, were the main cause of nest failure. Changes in agricultural practices would be a more effective means of increasing nesting success than predator control. Partridge breeding success may be improved by better management of agricultural areas, increasing the availability of lindes and slightly delaying cereal harvesting. These data may have implications for other endangered steppe-birds with similar nesting habitat, and may provide the basis for effective and successful collaborative programmes between hunters and conservationists.

AB  - Developing sound harvest strategies for wild turkey populations requires geographically specific information on population dynamics. The absence of this information prompted us to investigate the reproductive ecology of a hunted population of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) in southwestern Wisconsin during 1989-92. Nesting rates averaged 0.927 and were higher for adults than subadults (P = 0.003, n = 220). No age-specific differences were detected for renesting rates (P = 0.413, n = 147), nest success for first (P = 0.549, n = 199) or second (P = 0.685, n = 81) attempts, mean clutch size (P = 0.300, n = 37), or mean number of eggs hatched (P = 0.304, n = 24). Hen success averaged 0.217 (n = 212). Hen success was higher for adults than subadults (P = 0.047) and did not vary among years (P = 0.254). Mammalian predation was the primary factor affecting reproductive success. The level of recruitment during the study n as inadequate to maintain the population.

AB  - Hunting causes direct mortality and potentially disrupts normal activities of game and non-game species. As spatial (i.e., selection of hunting areas) and temporal (i.e., only diurnally present) patterns of hunters can become predictable, hunted species may respond accordingly. Risk becomes more dynamic and complex for species that are hunted concurrent with their breeding cycle, and growing literature has noted that wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo spp.) behaviors can be altered by hunting activity. We allocated global positioning system (GPS) units to 1,500 wild turkey hunters and affixed GPS transmitters to 175 wild turkeys during 2014-2018 on the Webb Wildlife Management Area Complex in South Carolina, USA. We evaluated whether wild turkeys shifted resource selection as a function of hunter resource selection during the progression of hunting seasons. Male wild turkeys avoided areas where stationary hunting bouts occurred during the early hunting season (and selected for these areas before hunting began), whereas females were more likely to select those areas avoided by males by the end of the hunting season. For every 15% increase in predicted probability of an area being hunted, male wild turkeys were 4.16 times less likely to select that area, whereas female wild turkeys were 1.08 times more likely to select that area relative to pre-season periods when hunters were not on the landscape. Hunting activity induced immediate responses by male wild turkeys as they sought refuge away from hunted areas. Coupled with recent research suggesting hunters are more influential than natural predators in reducing the frequency of male vocalizations and eliciting fleeing and avoidance behavior, our results indicate hunting activity could affect distribution and courtship behaviors of male wild turkeys during their breeding season.        Risk of harvest is complex for species that are hunted concurrent with their breeding cycle, and growing literature has noted that wild turkey behavior can be altered by hunting activity. Our work shows that hunting activity induced immediate responses by male wild turkeys as they sought refuge away from hunted areas; however, female response was muted at best. Coupled with recent research suggesting hunters are more influential than natural predators in reducing the frequency of male vocalizations and eliciting fleeing and avoidance behavior, our results indicate hunting activity could affect distribution and courtship behaviors of male wild turkeys during their breeding season. image

AB  - The 284 species of Galliformes are a highly threatened group of birds subject to direct exploitation for food, sport and cultural practices. The impact of hunting is often assumed to contribute to the high percentage of species (26.4%) listed as threatened with extinction in the IUCN Red List. We take a macroecological approach to examine the anthropogenic and ecological correlates of extinction risk and hunting pressure using linear and stepwise regression. Independent contrasts are analysed, as well as raw species data, to control for the potential confounding influence of phylogenetic trends. Extinction risk is found to be predicted both by the ecological factors considered (e.g., latitudinal range, body mass, elevational range, habitat use) and secondarily by human factors (e.g., human population density, total calorie intake, composition of diet). Hunting pressure itself is also predicted well for the threatened species by several of the anthropogenic and ecological variables. The study demonstrates that human variables can be used successfully to predict extinction risk, and represent an improvement upon methods which examine ecological variables alone. Furthermore, we show that individual threats can be explored using similar techniques, providing a more detailed insight into the processes leading to extinction. As applied to the Galliformes, both approaches provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that hunting pressure has contributed to the high proportion of threatened species in this group, and thus reinforce the case for urgent measures to reduce the impacts of direct exploitation upon these birds.

AB  - Arctic foxes Vulpes lagopus (L.) display a sharp 3- to 5-year fluctuation in population size where lemmings are their main prey. In areas devoid of lemmings, such as Iceland, they do not experience short-term fluctuations. This study focusses on the population dynamics of the arctic fox in Iceland and how it is shaped by its main prey populations. Hunting statistics from 1958-2003 show that the population size of the arctic fox was at a maximum in the 1950s, declined to a minimum in the 1970s, and increased steadily until 2003. Analysis of the arctic fox population size and their prey populations suggests that fox numbers were limited by rock ptarmigan numbers during the decline period. The recovery of the arctic fox population was traced mostly to an increase in goose populations, and favourable climatic conditions as reflected by the Subpolar Gyre. These results underscore the flexibility of a generalist predator and its responses to shifting food resources and climate changes.

AB  - We conducted a survey in the western Himalaya of India to assess animal extraction patterns. Data on animal species and their extraction patterns, their importance to the respondents, and reasons and methods of hunting were collected using structured questionnaires. Twenty-three species of large mammals and Galliformes were present in the area, 18 of which were hunted around at least one village. Of special concern were several threatened species that were hunted around most villages were they occurred, although the impact of removal on wild populations is not clear. The main reason for hunting was to supplement animal protein, although some animals were also killed for sale of meat and their parts. The establishment of community-managed forests has not had an impact on extraction rates. Assessment of the impact of hunting on the threatened species in particular is urgently required.

AB  - Research on long-lived iteroparous species has shown that reproductive success may increase with age, until the onset of senescence, and that prior reproductive success may influence current reproductive success. Such complex reproductive dynamics can complicate conservation strategies, especially for harvested species. Further complicating the matter is the fact that most studies of reproductive costs are only able to evaluate a single measure of reproductive effort. We systematically evaluated the effects of climatic variation and reproductive trade-offs on multiple reproductive vital rates for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse), a relatively long-lived galliforme of conservation concern throughout western North America. Based on over a decade of field observations, we hypothesized that reproduction is influenced by previous reproductive success. We monitored hen reproductive activity from 1998 to 2010, and used generalized linear mixed models to assess effects of climate and previous reproductive success on subsequent reproductive success. Reproductive trade-offs manifested as chronic effects on subsequent reproduction and were not apparent in all measures of subsequent reproduction. Neither nest initiation nor clutch size were found to be affected by climatic variables (either year t = 1 or t) or previous reproductive success. However, both nest and brood success were affected by climatic variation and previous reproductive success. Nest success was highest in years with high spring snowpack, and was negatively related to previous brood success. Brood success was positively influenced by moisture in April, negatively associated with previous nest success, and positively influenced by previous brood success. Both positive and negative effects of previous reproduction on current year reproduction were observed, possibly indicating high levels of individual heterogeneity in female reproductive output. Our results support previous research in indicating that climatic variability may have significant negative impacts on reproductive rates.

AB  - Changes in abundance and the risk of extinction of the rock partridge Alectoris graeca saxatilis in the Dolomitic Alps were investigated using a density-dependent model that incorporated dispersal and environmental stochasticity. The study was based on spring and summer counts collected from sample areas in geographically distinct mountain groups. Extinction probability was investigated by simulating a discrete population and a metapopulation consisting of local populations connected by dispersal. Persistence was not guaranteed when the species was examined as a discrete population. When we used a metapopulation approach, the persistence was assured but local extinctions with subsequent recolonizations of a number of empty areas were observed. The analysis was repeated using hunting statistics, when there were no restrictions on hunting policies, and a similar high extinction pattern was found. Our simulations suggested that long-term persistence of rock partridge could be guaranteed only when immigration was included into the demographic model. However, if the increased population's fragmentation recorded since the 1950s persists the extinction of some of the subpopulations appears inevitable.

We captured and radiomarked 2,647 bobwhites (286 adult [ad] M, 1,064 juvenile [juv] M, 185 ad F, and 1,049 juv F) to obtain estimates. We estimated that annual survival (Nov-Oct) averaged 0.068 +/- 0.018 (SE) and ranged between 0.018 +/- 0.048 and 0.211 +/- 0.038. We pooled data over the study period and found that sex-age classes survived at similar rates. We estimated average annual isolated rates of bobwhite mortality (rates in the absence of other causes) to be 0.63 +/- 0.027 from raptor predation, 0.45 +/- 0.021 from mammal predation, and 0.45 +/- 0.043 from harvest. Under the additive theorem of probability, the isolated rates translated to an average annual mortality rate of 0.88 +/- 0.017. The bobwhite population had variable and sometimes low survival in November-February inclusive. Low monthly survival (<0.5, n = 7) during winter was due primarily to harvest (0.57 +/- 0.099 losses/known-fate individual) and raptor predation (0.25 +/- 0.051 losses/known-fate individual). We discuss evidence indicating that radiotransmitters handicapped bobwhites and resulted in survival estimates biased low and to uncertainty in interpretation of cause-specific mortality.

AB  - Heather moorland is an important ecosystem found in Northern England and Scotland. It is sustained by management practices associated with sheep production and grouse shooting. There exist equilibria between the shooting firm and grazier that depend upon the relative profitability of sheep production and grouse shooting, the distribution of property rights between the grazier and shooting firm, and the scope for the firms to co-operate in heather management and negotiate reduced stocking rates. The forms of equilibria are explored for a representative moor using a dynamic simulation model that includes a dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal shoot. Results illustrate the production possibilities between grouse shooting and sheep production and the optimal shooting strategies for different states of the heather. They also clearly demonstrate the current policy of paying a headage subsidy on sheep runs counter to conservation objectives.

AB  - We developed broad-scale habitat selection models for the distribution of red- legged partridge Alectoris rufa in a low- density area in northwestern Spain, the BaixaLimia site of community importance (SCI). The fieldwork consisted of ground surveys in 1 x 1 km squares. For habitat selection analysis, we used a 2 x 2 km grid integrating the information obtained in the 1 x 1 km squares. As predictors we used environmental variables measured on digital 1: 50,000 scale cartography using a geographical information system (GIS). The red- legged partridge was scarce in the study area. The logistic regression analysis carried out on data from the squares with probable and confirmed breeding included the area of scrubland and pastureland with a positive sign. Using the breeding index category (BIC) three variables produced a slightly positive response: area of scrubland and pastureland, length of border between scrublands and forests, and length of border between forests and dams. The difficulty for modelling the habitat selection of this species could be due to human activities (hunting, habitat loss, restocking of hunt species), and may have modified their habitat preferences. Furthermore, the occupation of suboptimal habitats would distort the real habitat preferences.

AB  - Successful restoration of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) to Wisconsin has stimulated increased interest in hunting and a need for specific management information. We determined survival and causes of mortality for 224 radiomarked hens during 1988-94 in Vernon County, Wisconsin under a relatively liberal fall harvest regime. Annual survival ranged from 43.1 to 66.0 and averaged 52.7% (SE = 4.8). Seasonal survival averaged 72.2 (SE = 2.9), 81.3 (SE = 3.3), and 89.3% (SE = 2.5) during recruitment (16 Mar to 14 Jul), post-recruitment (15 Jul to 21 Nov), and winter (22 Nov to 15 Mar), and was lower (P = 0.001) during recruitment than during winter. Predation accounted for 71.2% of all deaths and was highest during recruitment. Localized starvation occurred during a winter with 49 consecutive days of deep snow and cold temperatures. Cumulative fall hunter densities were about 3.5/km(2) of woodland and the fall harvest rate of radioed hens averaged 7.3%. Turkey densities declined during the study and more conservative fall harvests may be necessary.

AB  - Information on survival rates of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) hens in the Southeast is limited, particularly on areas dominated by pine (Pinus spp.) plantations. Because wildlife managers are concerned about the effect of increasing pine plantation acreage in the Southeast and the implications of autumn either-sex harvests on turkey populations, we determined annual and seasonal survival rates of 111 transmitter-equipped hens from 1 january 1987 until 31 December 1990 in Kemper County, Mississippi. Annual survival averaged 68.3% and ranged from 49.9 to 81.0%. Seasonal survival averaged 92.5 (SE = 0.24), 81.4 (SE = 0.37), 96.7 (SE = 0.18), and 93.8% (SE = 0.27) for winter (Jan-Mar), spring (Apr-Jun), summer (Jul-Sep), and autumn (Oct-Dec), respectively. Most (95%) hen mortality was caused by predation, 69% of which occurred during the nesting and brood-rearing period. Survival rates were similar to those obtained for hens in more ''traditional'' habitats. High survival during autumn suggests autumn harvest may decrease over-winter survival of hens, and emphasizes the need for more intensive study of the effects of autumn either-sex hunting seasons on turkey populations.

AB  - We analyzed the viability of the Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) population of North Park, Colorado, to evaluate its supposed decline due to hunting pressure and habitat degradation. Demographic data from 23 years of surveys were used to parameterize a post-breeding, female-based projection matrix with three life stages:juveniles, yearlings, and adults The population was found to be approximately stable or in decline only if immigration and apparent surveying errors were factored from the data set. Adult and juvenile survival and adult and juvenile reproduction, respectively, were identified as the most limiting demographic factors. Empirical evidence from designed experiments with Sage Grouse has shown that these demographic factors respond markedly to habitat manipulations, especially brush manipulation. Several plausible management scenarios were evaluated with 100-year population projections generated through Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations), sampling from a normal probability distribution entraining the observed variability in each demographic parameter (95% confidence limits). Habitat manipulations to achieve moderate levels (similar to 15% canopy cover) of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) are recommended Regression analyses with power tests showed correspondence between hunting mortality and total mortality for juveniles and adults. Provided that habitat manipulations improve the survival of juveniles and adults, population viability may be conserved without reducing harvest by hunters.

AB  - Population genomics applied to game species conservation can help delineate management units, ensure appropriate harvest levels and identify populations needing genetic rescue to safeguard their adaptive potential. The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) is rapidly declining in much of the eastern USA due to a combination of forest maturation and habitat fragmentation. More recently, mortality from West Nile Virus may have affected connectivity of local populations; however, genetic approaches have never explicitly investigated this issue. In this study, we sequenced 54 individual low-coverage (similar to 5X) grouse genomes to characterize population structure, assess migration rates across the landscape to detect potential barriers to gene flow and identify genomic regions with high differentiation. We identified two genomic clusters with no clear geographic correlation, with large blocks of genomic differentiation associated with chromosomes 4 and 20, likely due to chromosomal inversions. After excluding these putative inversions from the data set, we found weak but nonsignificant signals of population subdivision. Estimated gene flow revealed reduced rates of migration in areas with extensive habitat fragmentation and increased genetic connectivity in areas with less habitat fragmentation. Our findings provide a benchmark for wildlife managers to compare and scale the genetic diversity and structure of ruffed grouse populations in Pennsylvania and across the eastern USA, and we also reveal structural variation in the grouse genome that requires further study to understand its possible effects on individual fitness and population distribution.

AB  - Predator-prey relationships are of general interest in ecology and have been studied extensively. They are also of interest for effective management and recovery of prey populations. However, quantification of these relationships in the field has remained difficult. We analysed the impact of the predation of red fox Vulpes vulpes on brown hare Lepus europaeus, grey partridge Perdix perdix and rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus using yearly hunting bag records as population indicators in eight German provinces over a period of 41 years. Bag records were tested for deviation from properties of suitable population indicators. We quantified the association between prey and predator populations within the context of other variables such as weather and long-term trends. We used an overall regression model for each prey population and discussed three statistical approaches accounting for the time series structure of the data. Models for all prey species populations display a good fit. The fox population has a significant negative association to the hare population in all models. The results for the rabbit population show only a small effect of the fox population, though it is not significant. The effect of the fox population on the partridge population cannot be clearly distinguished from a general trend. Additionally, there is a strong long-term trend in the hare and partridge populations. This could be due to major changes in the agricultural landscapes over the last decades. It is important to note that this trend is much stronger than the association to the fox population. Our study suggests that habitat improvement could be much more effective in restoring prey populations than fox control due to the minor interactions between the fox and the prey populations.

AB  - Food items in two sets of Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus jamesi) esophageal crops collected during two annual hunting seasons in northeastern Montana, demonstrate a number of significant differences (P < 0.05) in the volumes, masses and frequencies of occurrence of food items consumed. Volume and mass percentages of total plant materials in the 1976 sample were significantly less than values recorded in 1979. Juniper (Juniperus spp.) and Wood's Rose (Rosa woodsii), were the most utilized plants in 1976, whereas Buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea) and Skunkbush Sumach (Rhus aromatica) comprised the bulk of vegetation eaten in 1979. Grasshoppers occurred in 81% of the crops in 1976 and provided significantly more diet volume and mass than in 1979. This reflected the relative abundance and high availability of grasshoppers in the study area in 1976. Twenty-two species of acridid grasshoppers in three subfamilies were identified in the 1976 sample. Most of these grasshoppers (82%) were in the genus Melanoplus.

AB  - Rural mail carrier surveys (RMCS) have been used to track populations of game animals in the United States for many years, but few states employ RMCS data to track populations of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). Fourteen years (1987-2000) of RMCS data and hunter harvest data were examined for trends in wild turkey population dynamics in Kansas. Exponential expansion was seen in five of the six regions of the state, the only exception being the southwest, where the population dynamics did not differ significantly from a zero-growth model. Although no population estimates exist for comparison with the relative indices generated from the RMCS data, the residuals from respective exponential models, which represent stochastic fluctuations in turkey abundance, were correlated among adjacent regions of the RMCS, suggesting that the RMCS is internally consistent. Comparisons of RMCS indices with hunter harvest survey data are suggestive of a Type-I functional response curve in the fall hunting season and a Type-II functional response curve in the spring hunting season. Changes in current management strategies are proposed to increase harvest in response to the observed growth of wild turkey populations in Kansas.

AB  - Planning for either a single species, multiple species, or ecosystems is greatly dependent on spatial interactions in the landscape. Problems exist for evaluating wildlife habitat changes over large ranges of space and time. This paper illustrates the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to evaluate habitat for a single species, ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), following a time series of forest harvests. A habitat suitability model for ruffed grouse is utilized on a two-township study area in north-central Minnesota to assess the habitat suitability changes over time using an even-aged area-control harvesting plan. The results are presented as a habitat quality change map and a contingency table, representing the movement of habitat class areas between time periods resulting from the proposed harvesting. We developed a neighborhood definition to allow for spatially varying habitat values. This work illustrates the ability to 'look ahead' and 'around' in estimating the impact on wildlife habitat resulting from alternative future management activities.

AB  - A new high-voltage transmission line in north-central Nevada, USA, was considered a potential threat to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) because avian predators are attracted to and hunt from elevated perches. As a mitigation measure, perch deterrents were installed on the transmission line towers at the time of construction; in addition, 2 existing high-voltage transmission lines were retrofitted with deterrents. Previous published studies have investigated the efficacy of perch deterrents in preventing or reducing electrocution of avian predators and fecal contamination of insulators, but none have evaluated deterrents as a means of eradicating perching on towers. We conducted point transect surveys and perching-duration observations of corvids and raptors and determined that although perch deterrents did not prevent perching, the perching duration of raptors on the deterrents was reduced compared to other perching substrates. Perching of raptors indicated that some hunting most likely took place from the towers; therefore, the deterrents did not completely obviate the threat that avian predators posed to greater sage-grouse. Although the deterrents reduced the probability of avian predators perching on the towers, avian predators overcame the deterrents to take advantage of the height of the towers where no other perches of similar height existed. The perch deterrents as designed did not have the desired short-term effect on avian predators, but further monitoring may reveal longer-term effects and distinguish perching behaviors specific to different species of avian predators.

AB  - Uncertainties about future states of wildlife populations make it difficult to pre-adapt to possible threats and ensure sustainability of resources and harvesting over the long term. This uncertainty is partly due to the unknown impact and future states of many factors that explain population sizes and variation. In this paper, the effect of local game management activities on the uncertainty of future population sizes of groups of Finnish wildlife species (ungulates, forest grouse, large predators, small predators and mountain hare) was analysed using expert knowledge and the Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) modelling techniques. As a result, the current knowledge and agreement of the relationships between wildlife population sizes and the game management activities explaining their variation as well as trends are evaluated. Information given to hunters and the number of hunters were seen as the most effective factors for the management of game populations. However, there were great uncertainties in the expectations regarding future trends in the management activities, especially in feeding, and there was disagreement in the direction of the trend in the length of the hunting season. The trends in the size of forest grouse populations were viewed as the most uncertain trend among species groups. At the same time, forest grouse were seen as the most regulated species group by local game management. Among interest variables, experts were very uncertain and they disagreed about the direction of the trend in the recreational value of hunting.

AB  - We studied the population dynamics of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallupavo silvestris) in southwestern Wisconsin during 1987-94 to better understand the effects of variation in reproduction and fall harvest on growth of a northern population. We combined yearly estimates of reproduction, survival, and population size in a stochastic population model to estimate the finite rate of increase of the population. Our model indicated recruitment during 1989-92 was inadequate to offset observed mortality: the finite rate of increase was 0.831 +/- 0.097 (x +/- SE). The simulated trend was corroborated by declines in spring harvest success and observations of turkeys by deer hunters. We illustrate that population growth is affected by variation in both reproduction and fall harvest rates. The population decline was apparently caused by reduced recruitment in combination with reduced hen survival associated with initiation of fall hunting. The decline in recruitment was associated with cold and wet spring weather (r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.001). Analysis of 103 years of weather data suggested the low level of recruitment observed during 1989-92 may be representative of the long-term recruitment potential of this population. More conservative harvest strategies may be appropriate for northern populations.

AB  - We studied the numerical response of a population of the common buzzard Buteo buteo Lto the fluctuations of its main prey (voles) and alternative prey (forest grouse) in western Finland between 1979 and 1996. Populations of main prey fluctuated in a cyclic manner with three years between peak densities. The nesting success of buzzards averaged 1.7 fledglings per nesting attempt and the brood size averaged 2.2 fledglings per brood. The nesting rate (no. of active nests per number of occupied territories) and the productivity rate (no. of chicks for all territories) positively correlated with the abundance of Microtus voles in the current spring but not with the abundance of grouse. The Alternative Prey Hypothesis (APH) predicts that, in the years when the main prey species decline, generalist predators can shift their diet to alternative prey and thus cause its decline. The Shared Predation Hypothesis (SPH) states that all important prey species, including alternative prey, are under high hunting pressure when the density of predators is high. The predation rate (the combination of numerical response and previously studied functional response) of Microtus voles by buzzards was positively correlated with the densities of these voles in the current spring, whereas the predation rate of grouse tended to peak one year after peak densities of Microtus voles. Therefore, our results appear to support APH rather than SPH and indicate that predation by buzzards may dampen population cycles of main prey (voles) but amplify population fluctuations of grouse.

AB  - We analysed exposure to Pb and its relationship with lead-based ammunition in seven species of terrestrial game birds-common woodpigeon (Columba palumbus), rock dove (Columba livia), stock dove (Columba oenas), European turtle-dove (Streptopelia turtur), red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), Barbary partridge (Alectoris barbara) and common quail (Coturnix coturnix)-from rural and urban areas in different parts of Spain (Valencia, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y Leon, Madrid, Islas Canarias and Navarra). A total of 530 liver samples were analysed, and the presence of Pb pellets was studied in the crop, gizzard and intestine; the state and appearance of these organs were also analysed. The number of specimens suspected to have ingested Pb shot was 28 (5.6%), and the geometric mean concentration of hepatic Pb was 0.054 mu g g(-1) (wet weight, ww). A low percentage of samples (4.8%) were above the abnormal exposure threshold (0.65 mu g g(-1) ww), and, in these specimens, renal Pb concentrations were determined. Common woodpigeons and rock doves from Madrid were found to have high concentrations of Pb in their livers, and, so, both species can be considered to be good bioindicators of Pb contamination in rural (common woodpigeons) and urban (rock doves) environments. Partridges bred for hunting may be more prone to ingesting pellets from the environment, a fact that should be taken into account in management decisions.

AB  - Numerous studies provide estimates of nesting propensity rates (proportion of females attempting to nest at least once in a given year) for greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus. However, females may initiate nests without being detected during the course of normal research, leading to negatively biased estimates. We evaluated nesting propensity rates (rate of females laying >= 1 egg/y) by examining ovaries from 941 female sage-grouse collected at hunter-check stations in North Park, Colorado, during 1975-1984. Mean rate estimates of nesting propensity were lower for yearlings (0.926, 95% CI = 0.895-0.948) than adults (0.964, 95% CI = 0.945-0.978). We did not attempt to estimate laying rates (number of eggs laid per year) because they were likely unreliable. Nesting success-estimated as the probability of females producing a successful clutch in a given year based on primary feather replacement from hunter-harvested wings-was lower for yearlings (0.398, 95% CI = 0370-0.427) than adults (0.571, 95% CI = 0.546-0.596). There were more chicks per female produced when nesting propensity rates were high, indicating nesting propensity rates correlate with the number of juveniles in the autumn population. Both nesting propensity rates and nesting success were positively related to precipitation during the lekking and brood-rearing seasons, respectively. Nesting propensity rates were positively related to spring abundance (as measured from annual lek counts), but nesting success was unrelated to spring abundance. A range-wide estimate of an unadjusted, apparent nesting propensity rate available from a previous study was approximately 7% lower than the North Park population. Postovulatory follicles provide a direct source of information on nesting propensity rates estimated from hunter-harvested sage-grouse. These estimated rates may prove useful to gain insights into annual variation of hunted populations' reproductive efforts.

AB  - The abundance of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) has decreased throughout their range. Managers often respond by considering improvements in harvest and habitat management practices, but this can be challenging if substantial uncertainty exists concerning the cause(s) of the decline. We were interested in how application of decision science could be used to help managers on a large, public management area in southwestern Florida where the bobwhite is a featured species and where abundance has severely declined. We conducted a workshop with managers and scientists to elicit management objectives, alternative hypotheses concerning population limitation in bobwhites, potential management actions, and predicted management outcomes. Using standard and robust approaches to decision making, we determined that improved water management and perhaps some changes in hunting practices would be expected to produce the best management outcomes in the face of uncertainty about what is limiting bobwhite abundance. We used a criterion called the expected value of perfect information to determine that a robust management strategy may perform nearly as well as an optimal management strategy (i.e., a strategy that is expected to perform best, given the relative importance of different management objectives) with all uncertainty resolved. We used the expected value of partial information to determine that management performance could be increased most by eliminating uncertainty over excessive-harvest and human-disturbance hypotheses. Beyond learning about the factors limiting bobwhites, adoption of a dynamic management strategy, which recognizes temporal changes in resource and environmental conditions, might produce the greatest management benefit. Our research demonstrates that robust approaches to decision making, combined with estimates of the value of information, can offer considerable insight into preferred management approaches when great uncertainty exists about system dynamics and the effects of management.

AB  - Globally, the overexploitation of wildlife presents one of the greatest challenges for biodiversity conservation and sustainable rural livelihoods. Research on the human dimensions of hunting is critical for identifying potential levers for behavioral change interventions. This is especially true in China where hunting threatens to extirpate avian species such as the green peafowl (Pavo muticus) and great hornbill (Buceros bicomis). Nevertheless, regulations restricting gun ownership and hunting have made interviews on this topic highly sensitive. Direct questions about conservation non-compliance are often affected by response bias such as refusals to answer or self-protective denials.        We used the randomized response technique (RRT) to estimate the prevalence and drivers of illegal hunting targeting four focal bird taxa (barbets, bulbuls, partridges, and pheasants). Furthermore, we used statistical models that have recently been introduced to the conservation science literature to perform multivariate analyses for RRT data. We measured economic, demographic, and attitudinal covariates that could be associated with hunting. We found high awareness of laws banning hunting in Southwest China, but we also observed that 29.2% of the adult male population may have hunted birds in the past year.        Contrary to previous findings highlighting subsistence and finance as major factors driving hunting, the most important predictors of hunting activity in this landscape were related to attitudes regarding the enjoyment of hunting. Extra-economic motivations, such as the entertainment value of hunting, may be under-appreciated drivers of hunting behavior. Behavioral change interventions such as pride campaigns may be a promising approach to regulate bird hunting in Xishuangbanna in collaboration with local communities.

AB  - The strong hunting pressure on the red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa, warranted its inclusion into the list of species of European conservation concern. During the last decades, restocking plans with farmed specimens have counterbalanced the hunting drawings from wild populations. Our concern was the study of A. rufa in the easternmost part of its range, the central Italy, to gain insights into the effects of this compensation practice on the genetic structure of its populations. Partridges from both a geographically isolated, long-time protected, wild population (Pianosa island, Tuscan Archipelago National Park) and two Tuscan farms (Bieri and Scarlino) were investigated. All the specimens were very similar in outward appearance, looking much like to A. rufa. Ninety-six sequences of both Cytochrome b and D-loop Control Region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were analysed to get evidence of ancestry at the population level, whereas, the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was employed to get fingerprinting at the individual level. Pianosa and Bieri populations showed both the A. rufa and Alectoris chukar mtDNA lineages, whereas the Scarlino one only the A. rufa-mtDNA line. However, a spread overall pattern of A. rufa x A. chukar hybridisation among specimens, whatever their mtDNA lineage could result to be, was disclosed by means of RAPD species-specific markers. This is the first genetically documented record of the A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids. The occurrence of the pure, native A. rufa genome in the easternmost part of the species' geographical range may be guessed to be virtual. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Study area boundaries often are delineated by subjective methods without considering animal movements and behavior and may result in inaccurate density estimates and incorrect research conclusions. Consequently, we delineated study area boundaries for use with capture-recapture models to calculate density estimates of wild turkey gobblers (Meleagris gallopavo). From january to March, 1984-89, 189 gobblers were captured by cannon-net or drug at 38 permanent bait sites in central Mississippi. Fifty-six marked gobblers were harvested f rom 17-19 March to 1 May 1984-89. As distance f rom bait sites increased, proportion of unmarked gobblers to marked gobblers increased. When the population estimate did not change (P > 0.05), the asymptotic radius was 7.4 km with a corresponding study area size of 17,343 ha. Density estimates ranged from 0.6 to 1.6 gobblers/km2 and averaged 0.9 gobblers/km2. Our data suggest that density estimates may be inflated when animals that have emigrated or were using only the periphery of the study area are considered residents.

AB  - Genetic diversity plays a vital role in biological conservation, especially for those species under the threat of habitat loss and fragmentation. In this study, 73 samples of Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), collected from 6 localities in Guangxi and Guizhou provinces of China, were used to examine the influences of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure based on 1143 bp sequence of mitochondrial DNA (D-Loop). The results showed that all populations expressed high genetic diversity while lacking genetic differentiation. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the haplotypes identified from the four putative populations (TXL, LX, PJ and LD) did not cluster into separate geographic branches. Despite habitat fragmentation, we failed to find evidence of genetic depletion or impediment of gene flow within the 6 localities. Therefore, the four geographical populations should be regarded as an identical management unit (MU). Based on our results, we suggest that habitat restoration and hunting prohibition for protection should be highlighted for the increased conservation of the Hume's pheasant.

AB  - During 1997 and 1998, we implemented a pilot investigation to compare survival, site fidelity, and reproductive characteristics ofrelocated wild northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) with that ofresident birds. We captured wild bobwhites (n = 74) on managed lands in southern Georgia and relocated them (> 1.6 km from capture sites) to sites nearby where density estimates revealed that population density was low compared to surrounding sites. We equipped translocated birds with radiotransmitters and released them in groups of 8-12. We also captured resident birds (n = 166) and simultaneously monitored them via radiotelemetry. We found no difference in survival (P = 0.82), nest production (P = 0. 19), or nest survival (P = 0.85) between relocated and resident bobwhites. This suggests that relocating wild bobwhites does not negatively impact their survival or reproductive output. Based on the results of the pilot study, we implemented a large-scale relocation to determine whether relocation can increase native bobwhite populations. Following the pilot study, during 2000-2002, we relocated wild bobwhites (n = 202) within property boundaries to 3 different sites where population densities were low. Although only 2 sites experienced a significant population increase, hunting records suggested a positive population response for all sites where relocation occurred. Hence, relocation of wild bobwhites prior to breeding season may augment low-density populations, isolated populations, or voids within populations. The utility of translocation may facilitate preservation and conservation of the northern bobwhite by augmenting restoration efforts focused on habitat management, affording species preservation in isolated habitats, and increasing population dynamics and demographics via genetic enrichment.

AB  - Statistical population reconstruction offers a robust approach to demographic assessment for harvested populations, but current methods are restricted to big-game species with multiple age classes. We extended this approach to small game and analyzed 14 years of age-at-harvest data for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Oregon, USA, in conjunction with radiotelemetry data to reconstruct annual abundance levels, recruitment, and natural survival probabilities. Abundance estimates ranged from a low of 26,236 in 1995 to a high of 39,492 in 2004. Annual abundance estimates for adult males were correlated with a spring lek count index (r = 0.849, P < 0.029). We estimated the average annual harvest mortality for the population to be 0.028, ranging from 0.021 to 0.031 across years. We estimated the probability of natural survival of adult females to be 0.818 (<(SE)over cap> = 0.052), somewhat higher than that of adult males ((S) over cap = 0.609, (SE) over cap = 0.163). Our precision in reconstructing the population was hampered by low harvest rates and the few birds tagged in the radiotelemetry investigations. Despite these issues, our analysis illustrates how modern statistical reconstruction procedures offer a flexible framework for demographic assessment using commonly collected data. This approach offers a useful alternative to small-game indices and would be most appropriate for species with 5 or more years of age-at-harvest data and moderate-to-heavy harvest rates.

AB  - This paper investigates the impacts from natural gas development, hunting, and cattle grazing on a typical Western U.S. rangeland ecosystem using a general equilibrium model that describes ecosystem dynamics. The study area is located in the region surrounding the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas project in southern-central Wyoming and analyzes the population densities of various species, net hunting benefits, cattle profits, and existence value of sage grouse. The general equilibrium model analyzes the responses of six animal species, two plant species, and accounts for differences in prey scarcity inside and outside the disturbed areas around the wells. The differences in scarcity arise from sage grouse, mule deer, and elk experiencing stress in the disturbed areas and the changes in foraging behavior from the rest of the species. The simulations highlight the advantage of a general equilibrium ecosystem model because it is capable of capturing the complex changes that occur between plant and animal species when natural gas development reduces the habitat of vulnerable species. For the study area, the present-value loss in ecosystem services is $58.40 million (or $2,796 per ha), but could vary between -$0.12 and $81.67 million depending on the size of the disturbed area and coordination of government agencies.

AB  - Reliable vital rates for all life stages are necessary to identify limiting factors in wildlife populations and inform sound wildlife management. The difficulty associated with capturing and tagging precocial young, such as northern bobwhite chicks (Colinus virginianus), and linking variation in recruitment to ecological conditions has contributed to significant knowledge gaps in their population ecology. During 1999-2017, we captured and patagial-tagged <= 12-day-old bobwhite chicks (n = 3,576) and estimated their survival from time of capture (Jun-Sep) to fall and winter (Nov and Jan) recapture and winter (Feb) recovery. We used Burnham's model implemented in Program MARK to integrate mark-recapture and dead-recovery (via harvest) data to estimate survival for the 19-year study. By including weather covariates, we also evaluated explicit hypotheses related to temperature and precipitation effects on chick survival. We found inter-annual, intra-annual, and intra-seasonal variation in chick survival with an average annual daily survival estimate of 0.9887 (95% CI = 0.9321, 0.9918). Precipitation amount and number of precipitation (>0.635 cm) events during the first 4 weeks post-tagging decreased the daily survival rate of chicks curvilinearly. Average minimum daily temperature and maximum daily temperature effects on survival were negligible, but an interaction between minimum temperature and cumulative precipitation during the first 14 days post-tagging affected survival. We recommend population modelers incorporate intra- and inter-annual variation in chick survival to improve predictions. Observed variation in chick survival rates portends a significant opportunity to improve population management for bobwhites and other game birds. (c) 2019 The Wildlife Society

AB  - Using infrared video-surveillance systems during 1999-2000, we observed attempts by two individual Long-tailed Weasels (Mustela frenata) to depredate female Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) and their clutch of eggs. Neither female was captured despite Long-tailed Weasel attacks on multiple nights, but all eggs from one nest were either consumed or cached over a two-night period. Although Long-tailed Weasels have been shown to return quickly to areas of abundant prey, return visit behavior to locations where weasels were unsuccessful or only partially successful are poorly described.

AB  - We analyzed banding (3259) and recovery (six years) data from a hunted population of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus in northwestern Moffat County, Colorado to examine vulnerability to hunter harvests and annual survival of adult and hatch-year (juvenile) birds. Additionally, we combined the recovery data with hunter-harvested wings and applied the Lincoln estimator to provide unbiased estimates of tertiary sex-ratio. Our results yielded the following findings: juveniles were harvested at twice the rate of adults, but harvest vulnerability was similar between adult males and females. Annual survival of juveniles was highly variable but similar between sexes. Sex ratios of adults and juveniles largely conformed to previously assumed proportions despite having adjusted those estimates with harvest rates. We suggest there is potential to effectively model populations of game birds using a combination of band recovery and hunter-harvested samples of species that can be readily captured, marked and have reasonable harvest rates.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that cryptically colored eggs would suffer less predation than conspicuous eggs in the ground-nesting red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa. We used A. rufa as a model species because it has a wide range of natural egg colors, the eggs are widely available from breeding farms, and nests are easily mimicked because they are scrapes containing no vegetation. The study was conducted in the spring of 2001 in forest and fallow fields of central Spain in Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real. We used 384 clutches of natural eggs that were white, white spotted, brown, or brown spotted. Within clutches, eggs were consistent in color and size; among clutches, color differences were distributed across habitats. Clutches were checked once after 2 wk of exposure. Cryptic coloration had a survival advantage that was dependent on the local suite of predators. Rodent predation was nonselective with respect to clutch color; however, avian predation was significantly higher for conspicuous clutches. In addition, there was an interaction of landscape and egg color for avian predation. In forest landscapes, the clutches with highest survival were brown spotted, whereas in fallow landscapes, brown and brown spotted clutches had higher survival than white and white potted clutches. Thus, both the predator suite and the landscape had significant effects on the value of cryptic egg coloration. Our study is relevant for conservationists and managers in charge of restocking programs in hunting areas. The release of other partridge species or their hybrids could result in hybridization with wild partridges, potentially leading to nonoptimal clutch pigmentation and reduced survival of the native species. We therefore recommend that local authorities, managers, and conservationists be cautious with the use of alien species and hybrids and release only autochthonous species of partridges within their natural ranges.

AB  - Invasive alien species are a major cause of biodiversity loss. Nevertheless, non-native species can also contribute to conservation objectives. In 1673, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a galliform native to southwest Europe, was introduced from France (A. r. rufa) into the UK for hunting purposes. Nowadays, hunters constantly supplement natural populations of A. rufa in its native range with stocks of captive-bred individuals. Such birds are usually genetically unscreened, and human-mediated hybridization with the exotic chukar (Alectoris chukar) has undermined genomic integrity of the species. Alectoris rufa in the UK has never been genetically investigated, and birds from East Anglian estates with no modern history of supplementation offer a potential genomic backup for the highly polluted native-range A. r. rufa. We genotyped modern and ancient (1824-1934) birds at the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) level to determine present and past kinship between East Anglian and native-range A. rufa. We used Short Tandem Repeats (STR) and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to identify A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids. The kinship of East Anglian birds with A. r. rufa was confirmed. No A. chukar introgression was found in ancient East Anglian A. rufa. Among modern partridges, we found birds with A. chukar mtDNA, and both STRs and RAPDs disclosed many A. rufa 9 A. chukar hybrids. While the genetic analysis pointed to the increase of diversity and decline of disparity over time within and among A. rufa populations, respectively, the conservation value of the resource historically introduced to the UK proved to have been quashed by three decades of recent releases of A. chukar and its A. rufa hybrids.

AB  - Age-specific patterns of primary molt facilitate age classification of native North American upland gamebirds, a critical step in understanding their ecology, behavior, life history, population dynamics and harvest. However, deviations from typical molt patterns can create confusing plumages that complicate age classification. We examined data from live-captured greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus across seven studies in five U.S. states and wings from harvested birds in Oregon and Colorado for evidence of atypical primary molt. We documented atypical replacement through primary nine during preformative molt, atypical retention of juvenile primary 10 during second prebasic molt, and atypical retention of basic outer primaries during definitive prebasic molt. Atypical primary molts were observed more often in live-captured females (3.2%, n= 561) than males (0.8%, n=494). Many individuals with atypical primary patterns, especially females, are difficult or impossible to reliably age by plumage or morphology and may bias research and harvest data.

AB  - Hyperpredation can be described as a restrictive case of apparent competition where an increased number of primary prey species indirectly induces the decrease of the secondary prey species through numerical response of predators to the primary prey dynamics. It has been proposed that rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), which decimated populations of European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Spain, led to prey switching by raptors towards red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) causing declines in their populations as a peculiar case of hyperpredation.        We have reviewed field studies that disagree with estimates (based on bag records) of recent increases of rabbit and partridge numbers in Spain. Because of an increase in releases of farm-reared animals, there is doubt about the use of bag records to accurately estimate population trends in recent decades. We also provide new data and discuss some analytical considerations related to the temporal and spatial scales that might affect the interpretation of data. Finally, we discuss why studies associated with raptor food habits, predator population dynamics and predator distribution suggest that diet data are not sufficient to link patterns and processes. Although we agree that the RHD outbreak has markedly affected rabbit populations, which has indirectly affected many other species in the Iberian Peninsula, we consider that hyperpredation mediated by raptors has not been clearly demonstrated. In contrast, endorsing the hypothesis of raptor-mediated hyperpredation without sufficient proof may have conflictive consequences if we consider the increased persecution of raptors in recent decades in Spain.

AB  - 1. Tourism and leisure activities have increased continuously all over the world during the past decades, exerting a growing pressure upon naturally fragile ecosystems, such as mountainous habitats. Recent studies have established that disturbance by outdoor winter sports (e.g. skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing) is a source of stress for wildlife. This may in turn affect its abundance, but we still lack quantitative evidence.        2. We tested the effect of outdoor winter sports (ski lifts and related recreational activities) on the abundance of the alpine black grouse Tetrao tetrix, a vulnerable indicator species of the timberline ecosystem, the favoured habitat for outdoor winter sports in the European Alps.        3. Generalized linear models and a model selection approach were used to rank environmental factors influencing black grouse abundance and to make predictions about population status in the theoretical absence of ski resorts. We modelled the number of displaying cocks along census transects in spring, as a function of habitat characteristics (vegetation structure and typology), ski lift density and hunting pressure at 15 natural sites (none or a very low level of anthropogenic disturbance) and 15 ski resorts in the south-western Swiss Alps.        4. Ski lift density and habitat typology were the principal determinants of black grouse abundance, whereas hunting pressure had no discernable effect. Ski lifts and related winter sport activities had a strong negative effect on the number of displaying cocks, which may have led to a mean 36% reduction of local abundance in ski lift areas, as determined after controlling for the confounding effect of habitat type.        5. Synthesis and applications. Conservation action plans for black grouse should aim at reducing the multiple negative effects generated by outdoor winter sports (ski facilities and related winter sport activities). First, vegetation patchiness (i.e. a mosaic of grassy shrubland with scattered trees) should be maintained along ski runs. Secondly, wintering preserves where human access is banned or strictly limited should be promoted within ski resorts. Spatially explicit human-wildlife conflict maps can be constructed from the present model to allow delineation of those areas likely to become effective protection areas.

AB  - Population growth is highly sensitive to changes in reproductive rates for many avian species. Understanding how reproductive rates are related to environmental conditions can give managers insight into factors contributing to population change. Harvest trends of eastern wild turkey in northeastern South Dakota suggest a decline in abundance. We investigated factors influencing reproductive success of this important game bird to identify potential factors contributing to the decline. We monitored nesting rate, nest survival, renesting rate, clutch size, hatchability, and poult survival of 116 eastern wild turkey hens using VHF radio transmitters during the springs and summers of 2017 and 2018. Heavier hens were more likely to attempt to nest than lighter hens, and adult hens were more likely to renest than yearling hens. Nest survival probability was lowest in agricultural fields relative to all other cover types and positively related to horizontal visual obstruction and distance to the nearest road. Daily nest survival probability demonstrated an interaction between temperature and precipitation, such that nest survival probability was lower on warm, wet days, but lowest on dry days. Egg predation was the leading cause of nest failure, followed by haying of the nest bowl and death of the incubating hen. Poults reared by adult hens had a greater probability of survival than poults reared by yearling hens. Our estimate of survival probability of poults raised by yearling hens was low relative to other studies, which may be contributing to the apparent regional population decline. However, there is little managers can do to influence poult survival in yearling hens. Alternatively, we found nest survival probability was lowest for nests initiated in agricultural fields. Wildlife-friendly harvesting practices such as delayed haying or installation of flushing bars could help increase productivity of eastern wild turkey in northeastern South Dakota.

AB  - The reliability of long-term population estimates is crucial for conservation and management purposes. Most game species population monitoring programs assume that count indices are proportionally related to abundance. However, this assumption is untenable when detection varies spatially and temporally. We assessed whether N-mixture models, which allow detection modeling using spatially and temporally repeated count data, were relevant for monitoring the population of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa). Unbiased estimates are needed for calculating hunting quotas for this game species. We used the simple aural playback point-countmethod and a dataset of 121 point-transects (n = 16,288 counts) collected from 1992 to 2010. Covariates such as date, hour, wind, rain, and vegetation density influenced detection probability. Estimated abundance ranged from 0 to 15 males per point and exhibited variable coefficients of variation depending on sites (range: 0.14-1.31, mean: 0.44). We found a positive and linear relationship between the abundance estimated by the N-mixture model and the densities provided by 2 other counting methods, square sampling and kilometric abundance index, but not with blank beat. We established a maximum detection radius for the playback surveys, which enabled conversion of abundance at the points into density. The N-mixture modeling approach is more cost-effective for game species monitoring than capture-recapture methods or square sampling, and more reliable than indices of relative abundances.

AB  - Multiple-brooding in quail was once thought to occur rarely; if at all, and interpretations of recruitment were based on the assumption of single-brooding. Recent research on northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) indicates double-and triple-brooding occur in widely separated geographic areas. We developed time-free and time-based models of multiple-brooding to explore the rule of this behavior in recruitment as indexed by autumn age ratios. Using empirical data on northern bobwhites, we found second and third broods contribute little to age ratios under a typical probability of nest success (0.3). Production is similar whether a hen quits laying after the first successful attempt, given 3 attempts, or whether a hen rises all 3 attempts. The time-based models suggest hatching phenologies obtained by backdating from wing molt may be biased (peak hatch is earlier than predicted by backdating). Management goals for high quail production should be to maximize the proportion of hens that lay, the probability of nest success, and the number of days in the laying season.

AB  - Climate change and habitat loss are recognized as important drivers of shifts in wildlife species' geographic distributions. While often considered independently, there is considerable overlap between these drivers, and understanding how they contribute to range shifts can predict future species assemblages and inform effective management. Our objective was to evaluate the impacts of habitat, climatic, and anthropogenic effects on the distributions of climate-sensitive vertebrates along a southern range boundary in Northern Michigan, USA. We combined multiple sources of occurrence data, including harvest and citizen-science data, then used hierarchical Bayesian spatial models to determine habitat and climatic associations for four climate-sensitive vertebrate species (American marten [Martes americana], snowshoe hare [Lepus americanus], ruffed grouse [Bonasa umbellus] and moose [Alces alces]). We used total basal area of at-risk forest types to represent habitat, and temperature and winter habitat indices to represent climate. Marten associated with upland spruce-fir and lowland riparian forest types, hares with lowland conifer and aspen-birch, grouse with lowland riparian hardwoods, and moose with upland spruce-fir. Species differed in climatic drivers with hares positively associated with cooler annual temperatures, moose with cooler summer temperatures and grouse with colder winter temperatures. Contrary to expectations, temperature variables outperformed winter habitat indices. Model performance varied greatly among species, as did predicted distributions along the southern edge of the Northwoods region. As multiple species were associated with lowland riparian and upland spruce-fir habitats, these results provide potential for efficient prioritization of habitat management. Both direct and indirect effects from climate change are likely to impact the distribution of climate-sensitive species in the future and the use of multiple data types and sources in the modelling of species distributions can result in more accurate predictions resulting in improved management at policy-relevant scales.

AB  - Intercropping legumes may reduce inputs and enhance sustainability of forage and feedstock production, especially on marginal soils. This approach is largely untested for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production, yet producer acceptance should be high given the traditional use of legumes in forage/agricultural systems. Our objectives were to evaluate three cool-season and two warm-season legumes and their required densities to influence yield and supply nitrogen (N) compared to three inorganic N levels (0, 33, and 66 kg N ha(-1) [0, 30, and 60 lb N ac(-1)]) at three locations in Tennessee (Knoxville [Sequatchie Silt Loam], Crossville [Lilly Loam], and Milan [Loring B2 Series]). Fall of 2010 seeded, cool-season legumes (red clover [Trifolium pratense L.], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa L.], ladino clover [Trifolium repens L.]), arrowleaf clover (Trifolium vesiculosum L.), and a spring of 2011 seeded, warm-season legume (partridge pea [Chamaecrista fasciculate L.]) were interseeded into switchgrass at three (high, medium, and low) seeding rates each in two experiments. Harvest treatments were annual single, postdormancy biofuel (Experiment One) or integrated forage-biofuel (preanthesis and postdormancy; Experiment Two). Year one yield impacts were minimal. During the second harvest year, legumes increased yield versus Year 1; in general, yields for 33 and 67 kg N ha(-1) did not differ from those for red clover, hairy vetch, ladino clover, or partridge pea (p < 0.05). Arrowleaf clover yields were not different from 0 kg N ha(-1). Forage biomass yields were generally more responsive to legumes (p < 0.05) than the biomass regime. Legume persistence after three years was generally greatest for ladino clover and partridge pea. Forage quality (switchgrass only) in some cases was positively influenced by legume treatments, notably hairy vetch and partridge pea (p < 0.05). Intercropping selected legumes in switchgrass may enhance forage quality and yield while reducing nonrenewable inputs, fertilizer costs, and emissions/runoff to air and groundwater.

AB  - The lack of management experience at the landscape scale and the limited feasibility of experiments at this scale have increased the use of scenario modeling to analyze the effects of different management actions on focal species. However current modeling approaches are poorly suited for the analysis of viability in dynamic landscapes. Demographic (e.g., metapopulation) models of species living in these landscapes do not incorporate the variability in spatial patterns of early successional habitats, and landscape models have not been linked to population viability models. We link a landscape model to a metapopulation model and demonstrate the use of this model by analyzing the effect of forest management options on the viability of the Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) in the Pine Barrens region of northwestern Wisconsin (U.S.A.). This approach allows viability analysis based on landscape dynamics brought about by processes such as succession, disturbances, and silviculture. The landscape component of the model (LANDIS) predicts forest landscape dynamics in the form of a time series of raster maps. We combined these maps into a time series of patch structures, which formed the dynamic spatial structure of the metapopulation component (RAMAS). Our results showed that the viability of Sharp-tailed Grouse was sensitive to landscape dynamics and demographic variables such as fecundity and mortality. Ignoring the landscape dynamics gave overly optimistic results, and results based only on landscape dynamics (ignoring demography) lead to a different ranking of the management options than the ranking based on the more realistic model incorporating both landscape and demographic dynamics. Thus, models of species in dynamic landscapes must consider habitat and population dynamics simultaneously.

AB  - Grassland birds have experienced protracted population declines, primarily due to loss and degradation of native grasslands. Restoration of native grasses may benefit grassland birds, but such restoration within the eastern United States has been limited. Production uses of native grasses (e.g., hay, pasture, bio-fuel feedstock) provide market-based incentives that could lead to more extensive use of these grasses than existing conservation-focused practices, potentially influencing breeding birds. Therefore, we compared breeding bird (n = 9 target species) relative abundance among 4 types of native warm-season grass (NWSG) agricultural production fields: forage (hay and pasture; n = 22 and 7, respectively), seed (n = 21), biofuel (n = 15), and a control (idle fields in conservation programs or practices; n = 37) in Kentucky and Tennessee, 2009-2010. We detected 2 145 birds, with field sparrow (Spizella pusilla, 43%) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus, 27%) encountered most often. Relative abundance did not differ between production types and controls except for field sparrow (lower on seed production fields) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus, lower on hay production fields). Species richness equaled or exceeded that of control fields for all production categories. We documented negative relationships between relative abundance and landscape-scale forest cover for four species (field sparrow, grasshopper sparrow [Ammodramus savannarum], eastern meadowlark [Sturnella magna], and red-winged blackbird) and positive relationships with amount of pasture and hay cover for four species (northern bobwhite, grasshopper sparrow, eastern meadowlark, and red-winged blackbird), reinforcing the importance of nonforested environments for these species. We conclude that production stands could be a viable approach for increasing NWSG available for breeding birds and, when established in the appropriate landscape context, can provide benefits similar to those provided by conservation programs.

AB  - Since neonicotinoid insecticides were introduced to the agricultural market, evidence of the negative impacts of these systemic compounds on non-target species has accumulated. Birds are one of the largest groups of species to inhabit farmland, but the extent of neonicotinoid exposure in avian communities is poorly understood and very little is known about how any exposure may affect wild birds. Here, free-living gamebirds were used as a model group to measure the extent of avian exposure to the neonicotinoid dothianidin via seed treatment. During a typical sowing period of winter cereals treated with clothianidin, blood and liver samples were collected simultaneously from individual hunted gamebird carcasses, both pre- (n = 18) and post-sowing (n = 57) and were analysed for dothianidin via LC/MS-MS. Body weight, fat score and faecal parasite load were also quantified in the birds to ascertain whether any of these health parameters were associated with clothianidin exposure under field conditions. Clothianidin was detected in 6% of individuals sampled pre-sowing and 89% of individuals sampled post-sowing. The frequency of dothianidin detection in plasma samples and the concentration of dothianidin in liver and plasma samples decreased significantly between the first week and 2-4 weeks post-sowing. Faecal parasite load was positively associated with concentrations of clothianidin in the liver (but not plasma) of partridge species, but there was no association between clothianidin concentration and fat score or body weight, for either sample type. This study provides clear evidence that treated seed is a source of pesticide exposure for gamebirds following autumn sowing. These findings have implications for gamebirds worldwide where seed treatments are in use, and will aid the design of any future avian biomonitoring studies for agrochemical compounds.

AB  - Between 1979 and 2006, over 7,000 eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) from 16 states were translocated to east Texas in an attempt to restore a stable, huntable population. Although current populations are stable in some areas and a spring male-only hunting season was opened in 1995, turkey density in the region remains low and large areas of apparently suitable habitat are not occupied. The long-term effects of the extensive translocations and current levels of connectivity among various populations are unknown. We used microsatellite DNA analysis to assess the influence of translocations on current genetic structure and gene flow in eastern wild turkeys. The influence of translocations was clearly evident and reflected historical contributions from the Midwest and southeastern United States. The east Texas population consisted of 3 distinct genetic clusters. Despite a lack of clear geographic barriers and nearly contiguous forest cover in much of the east Texas landscape, regional gene flow among clusters appeared to be limited. Diversity in the regional population remains high, but we recommend that regulations reflect the current population structure and that long-term efforts should be made to increase connectivity among wild turkeys in the region.

AB  - The lack of adequate documentation of wildlife translocations, particularly details regarding the source stock used, have potentially serious implications for wildlife management. Poor documentation of translocations may lead to unintentional mixing of distinct types, potentially causing problems for future management, design of harvest programs, and evolutionary stability. In Kansas, we employed molecular tools and assignment methods to uncover the cryptic distribution of wild turkey subspecies resulting from decades of poorly documented translocations. Pure forms of Eastern (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) and Rio Grande turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) remain in many portions of the state, and future translocation programs now have the option to keep these distinct by prohibiting translocations between regions containing different subspecies. In addition, we documented 3 zones of hybridization: 1) at the interface between Eastern and Rio Grande subspecies, 2) in southwest Kansas where immigrant Merriam's turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo merriami) are mixing with translocated Rio Grande turkeys, and 3) surrounding an undocumented translocation of Eastern turkeys within a region characterized primarily by Rio Grande turkeys. The DNA-based techniques employed in this study were extremely informative tools for characterizing the distribution of wild turkeys in Kansas and suggest that such tools could be applied in a multitude of similar situations in other wildlife species.

AB  - We present a case study from New York, USA, of the use of structured decision making (SDM) to identify fall turkey harvest regulations that best meet stakeholder objectives, in light of recent apparent declines in abundance of wild turkeys in the northeastern United States. We used the SDM framework to incorporate the multiple objectives associated with turkey hunting, stakeholder desires, and region-specific ecological and environmental factors that could influence fall harvest. We identified a set of 4 fall harvest regulations, composed of different season lengths and bag limits, and evaluated their relative achievement of the objectives. We used a stochastic turkey population model, statistical modeling, and expert elicitation to evaluate the consequences of each harvest regulation on each of the objectives. We conducted a statewidemail survey of fall turkey hunters in New York to gather the necessary information to evaluate tradeoffs among multiple objectives associated with hunter satisfaction. The optimal fall harvest regulation was a 2-week season and allowed for the harvest of 1 bird/hunter. This regulation was the most conservative of those evaluated, reflecting the concerns about recent declines in turkey abundance among agency wildlife biologists and the hunting public. Depending on the region of the state, the 2-week, 1-bird regulation was predicted to result in 7-32% more turkeys on the landscape after 5 years. The SDM process provided a transparent framework for setting fall turkey harvest regulations and reduced potential stakeholder conflict by explicitly taking the multiple objectives of different stakeholder groups into account.

AB  - The grey partridge Perdix perdix is of conservation concern owing to habitat heterogeneity losses and the negative impact of other environmental factors, e.g., pesticide use, predators, weather or shooting pressure, which are known to be associated with population decline. By an 11-year-period study in an intensively cultivated farmland located in the Paris basin, we aimed to relate the changes in grey partridge population dynamics with the changes in agriculture, monthly rainfall and shooting pressure. Summer drought occurred at the middle time of the study period. At the start of our study, a new cultivation, winter-wheat broadcast in maize-stubble fields, was introduced that probably improved the habitat. But in the next years, there was a loss in habitat diversity due to the disappearance of pastures dedicated to sheep rearing, removal of non-cropped areas and field boundaries and increase in the mean field size. Shooting was annually adjusted to what the owner believed to be a wise harvest. In post-breeding coveys, both percentages of hens with young among total hens and young-to-successful hens ratios first increased and then decreased. The mean brood size was rather weak during the dryness incident. The number of pairs in a more heterogeneous sector was always greater than in a less one. In both sectors, spring abundance first increased and then decreased. In the second half of the study period, the shooting quotas were reduced, especially when the mean brood size fell down. Low hatching rates of clutches and low chick survival rates explain the population decline, as the results are convincing. To stop the population decline in intensive arable farmland, good breeding success is needed. This can be provided by favourable habitats for hens to nest and for chicks to feed.

AB  - In Lincoln County, Washington, USA, greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) are managed as reintroduced and augmented populations, respectively. Predation by raptors and corvids is a concern, particularly where utility poles may provide hunting perches near leks (i.e., breeding areas). Perch deterrents may offer a mitigating strategy if deterrents reduce the frequency or duration of perching. To investigate the effects of various perch deterrents, we deployed deterrents on 5 power poles retained for use in this study when 33 poles were removed from occupied grouse habitat. We rotated deterrents among poles every 15 to 28 days ((x) over bar = 19.4 days) from November 17, 2011, through November 20, 2012, so that all deterrents occurred multiple times on all poles. We compared perch frequency and duration on 4 pole caps, 3 insulator deterrents, an untreated control cross arm, and 5 cross-arm-length deterrents: Pupi (TM) cross arms mounted at a 22 degrees angle from horizontal; Birdzoff (TM) deterrents; an experimental shroud; Power Line Sentry X (TM) deterrents; and Zena Designs (TM) mini-spike deterrents. We collected 862 independent records of perching events. Raptors and corvids perched most often (chi(2) = 146.0, P < 0.0001) on untreated cross arms (<(x)over bar> = 0.60 perches/day), and insulator deterrents ((x) over bar = 0.47 perches/day), and perched least often on pole caps with spikes ((x) over bar = 0.11 perches/day) and Zena Designs mini-spikes ((x) over bar = 0.10 perches/day). Perching events were shorter on pole caps with spikes and Zena Designs mini-spikes compared to all other treatments (F-8,F-853 = 23.53, P < 0.0001). Prey captures also were significantly less likely from treated cross arms than from the control cross arm (chi(2) = 86.5, df = 4, P < 0.0001). Birds attempting to perch on deterrents often flapped their wings broadly where energized conductors would have existed if the poles had not been decommissioned. On energized poles, electrocution would have been possible in this situation. When perch deterrents are used, insulation or isolation of energized equipment also must be installed to minimize electrocution risk.

AB  - Increased tourism impact, recreational activities and structures in natural areas can affect wildlife by increasing urbanization, landscape fragmentation and disturbance. I examined the potential effects of tourist destinations on four forest grouse (Tetraoninae) and five mammalian species in northern Finland. I analyzed density data obtained from wildlife counts carried out by hunters around ten tourist destinations. The densities of mountain hare and mustelid species were negatively correlated with the distance to a tourist destination. The densities of adult grouse, juvenile grouse, mountain hare, and mustelids were positively correlated with the area of mixed forests surrounding the destinations. The densities of adult and juvenile grouse were positively correlated, while the densities of pine marten and mustelids were negatively correlated with the area of agricultural land surrounding the destinations. The densities of the studied wildlife species varied among destinations and years. It seems that current recreational activities have not caused significant changes in the occurrence and abundance of wildlife species in the surroundings of the tourist destinations studied. Location of a destination, predator densities, and landscape structure around the destination had the most impact on the density of wildlife species.        L'augmentation des effets du tourisme, des activit & eacute;s de r & eacute;cr & eacute;ation et des infrastructures dans les zones naturelles peut affecter la faune en augmentant l'urbanisation, la fragmentation du paysage et les perturbations. J'ai examin & eacute; les effets potentiels de destinations touristiques sur quatre esp & egrave;ces de Tetraoninae (t & eacute;tras, g & eacute;linottes et lagop & egrave;des) et cinq esp & egrave;ces de mammif & egrave;res dans le nord de la Finlande.

AB  - Hunting with lead ammunition represents a source of heavy metal pollution to the environment that can be potentially high at the local scale. Intensive hunting of small game species can concentrate high levels of ammunition discharging in small areas. This type of hunting is a relevant economic resource for private landowners in some regions of Spain, and current legislation allows the use of lead ammunition in these scenarios. It becomes, therefore, highly relevant to study whether this activity may pose concerns to the conservation of the environment in the areas where it takes place. Using a red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) shooting range as a study area, we examined the effect of intensive hunting on this species on the vegetation present. We found significantly higher lead levels in the sprouts of plants of shooting areas related to control sites of the same property where partridge shooting does not occur. We found differences in the presence of lead between sprouts of different plant species. In addition, old sprouts of existing vegetation in shooting areas also showed higher lead levels than newly emerged sprouts of the same plants. These results demonstrate the impact of lead ammunition on vegetation in terms of persistence over time and differences between species. Further analyses using chemical and ecotoxicological data are necessary to evaluate the extent of environmental pollution risks. Our results provide new support in favor of the use of alternative ammunition, with particular emphasis on scenarios where hunting activity is intensive.

AB  - People hunt and kill animals for sport in many parts of the world. This raises many issues, some of which were brought to the fore when a lion Panthera leo, nicknamed Cecil, was killed by a trophy hunter in Zimbabwe in 2015. Cecil's death led to an unprecedented public reaction in Europe and the USA, and a debate in which opponents and supporters of sport hunting advanced different types of argument based on, inter alia, conservation, animal welfare and economics.        The reaction to the Cecil event provides a perspective for scrutinizing sport hunting more widely. In this article we explore parallels between lion trophy hunting in Africa (which can involve either wild or captive-bred lions) and shooting of common pheasant Phasianus colchicus, a sport which is largely sustained in the UK by the annual release of over 40 million captive-bred birds.        These two forms of sport hunting share common themes that are likely to be influential for the future of sport hunting more widely. These include the extent to which sport hunting maintains land for wildlife, and the impacts of intensification (e.g. the extent to which quarry are reared and released). Concern for the welfare of quarry animals is a dominant theme in debates about hunting.        These themes are likely to be relevant for the conservation of many species hunted for sport. Increasing distaste for the killing of animals for sport in many countries may lead to the end of some types of sport hunting, with implications for both habitat and wildlife conservation. It would be both prudent and appropriate for conservationists to increase the urgency with which they seek alternative methods for preventing loss of biodiverse land to other uses.

AB  - Foraging theory predicts that mobile predators Such as raptors should hunt more frequently in habitat patches yielding the greatest energy gains. Raptor foraging distributions may, however, be constrained by nest location and by competition between different raptor species. We tested these hypotheses in a moorland raptor assemblage including two vole specialists and three generalist predators. We studied spatial and temporal variation in the foraging distributions of these raptors during breeding and non-breeding seasons on an area of moorland managed for red grouse in Scotland. We compared raptor foraging distributions to indices of prey abundance and availability, the habitat characteristics of foraging sites, and for some species, the distance from nest sites. We also assessed whether the foraging distributions of the smaller raptors were influenced by the larger raptors. Short-eared owls Asio flamnieus, kestrels Falco tinnunculus and common buzzards Buteo buteo showed pronounced temporal variation in foraging in either breeding or non-breeding seasons in response to fluctuations in the abundance of small mammals. Having removed year effects, however, spatial variation in foraging by these species within and outside the breeding season was not explained by small mammal abundance or availability. In contrast, the foraging distributions of hen harriers Circus cyaenus and peregrines Falco peregrinus showed no significant temporal variation. During the breeding season, male and female harriers foraged on areas near harrier nests. Outside the breeding season, female harriers foraged in areas with more grouse and small mammals. Peregrines showed no foraging response to prey during the breeding season but during the non-breeding season they hunted in areas with more grouse. There was little evidence that the foraging distributions of smaller raptors were influenced by larger raptors; however, golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos were rarely seen at our study site. These results suggest the simple dichotomy between specialist and generalist predators that masks a more complex response to prey abundance.

AB  - 1. An earlier paper related bird species richness to hedgerows and other field boundary attributes including adjacent land use. The study was over several years (winter and summer) at two sites, Huntingdon and Swavesey, in East Anglia UK.        2. The present paper deals with similar relationships, but the bird variables used are the abundance of individual species, of groups of species (all finches, all raptors, etc.) and of all birds, as well as Simpson's index of diversity. This required extensive modelling - 105 models for Huntingdon and 174 for Swavesey.        3. The results of all 279 models are presented in a condensed form, highlighting the importance of given field boundary attributes to particular species or groups of species.        4. Like bird species richness in the earlier paper, the abundance of many species was strongly influenced by the land use, and by the main vegetation variables (tree height and number, hedgerow length, height and width). Land use was important to a larger majority of species, the exceptions being carrion crow, pheasant, reed bunting and wren.        5. Verge width appeared important for small insectivores (blue tit) and was particularly important for seed eating birds, e.g. most finches and buntings, red-legged partridge in summer, and carrion crow and skylark in winter.        6. Ditch dimensions were associated with the abundance of some seed eaters (linnet, reed bunting and goldfinch) and insectivores (blackbird, great tit, skylark, song thrush and wren). Kestrel and the groups raptors, corvids, waders and aquatics were associated with large ditches.        7. Though the general management prescriptions to benefit the majority of farmland birds were found to be similar to those in the earlier paper, the detailed species specific modelling made it possible to examine the habitat requirements of particular species.        8. Ecological evaluation of the results from the two studies are presented in a form considered to be of value for practical management. Bird species and groups of birds are categorised with respect to their likely requirements of particular attributes of the field boundaries.

AB  - We examined edge-related predation in June-August 1998 on artificial ground nests associated with the retention of residual trees in harvested oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) stands in a state in Pennsylvania. We tested the hypothesis that predation rates on nests did not vary with distance from edge in retention stands and adjacent unharvested forest stands. Artificial nests were placed during five time periods (trials) in three representative retention stands in Rothrock State Forest along random transects at four distances perpendicular to the edge: 50 m into the retention stand, at the edge, 50 m into the adjacent forest, and 150 m into the adjacent forest. Artificial nests consisted of three large brown chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs to simulate nests of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) and Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). Twenty-three % (82/358) of the nests were disturbed during the five trials combined. Nest fate was not influenced by the distance of nests from the edge (P = 0.88). We also found an interaction between trial and site (P = 0.01); in particular, one site (Cooper's Gap) had much higher predation rates during trials 3-5 when abundances of American Crows (Corvas brachyrhynchos) were higher at the site. Predation rates observed in our study were comparable to those found elsewhere in other harvested forests of Pennsylvania. where the abundance of crows is known to be relatively low. Nest predation rates in retention stands probably did not vary with distance from edge because nests were well concealed by a dense layer of ground-level vegetation regardless of distance from an edge. We hypothesize that variation in predation rates among sites may be explained by differences in the degree of heterogeneity, i.e., extent of edges and amount of habitat contrast, within and among adjoining habitats. We conclude that habitat conditions created by retention stands do not have a major negative effect on the nesting success of common, ground-nesting gallinaceous birds.

AB  - Despite the known deleterious effects lead exposure can have on humans, lead remains the most common type of ammunition used to harvest big game and upland game birds. We sampled wild turkey Meleagris gallopavo breast muscle shot with standard lead and copper-plated lead pellets to quantify lead residue concentrations within the wound channel, and we sampled multiple adjacent locations to measure the extent lead contamination spreads through tissue of harvested turkeys. We found that samples taken from the wound channel contained more lead (mean = 3.76 mu g/g dry weight) than both samples taken adjacent to the wound channel (mean = 0.20 mu g/g dry weight) and samples taken from >5 cm away (mean = 0.15 mu g/g dry weight). Additionally, we found that birds harvested with standard lead ammunition did not differ in lead concentrations from those shot with copper-plated lead, suggesting that copper plating does not aid in reducing lead exposure. Our findings suggest that wild turkeys harvested with either lead or copper-plated lead shot have the potential to expose consumers, especially children due to their lower tolerance, to low levels of lead that could exceed daily consumption limits set by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control. However, elevated lead levels were confined to the wound channel, and thus proper preparation of game to remove tissue surrounding wound channels may eliminate or substantially reduce lead exposure from harvested game birds.

AB  - Alpine black grouse populations are generally declining, but the underlying demographic drivers are largely unknown. We studied the dynamics of two adjacent black grouse populations over a 20 years period in the Italian Alps that differ in hunting pressure to identify the main demographic process affecting these populations and to study the impact of hunting on males. We collected radio-tracking data and conducted population surveys in spring to count displaying cocks and in late summer to determine the breeding success by means of pointing dogs. These different data sets were jointly analysed using a seasonal integrated population model to estimate population sizes and various demographic rates. The two populations fluctuated in size and the number of males from one population increased after hunting intensity was reduced. The main demographic rates did not differ between the populations. Adult survival was relatively low and productivity was high, so the life history shows the feature of a fast turnover species. In both populations, the variability of survival from hatching to the age of five weeks (chick survival) contributed more to the variation of the population growth rates than the variability of survival in later life-history stages, and the former was positively affected by ambient temperatures in July, favouring chick survival. The adult sex ratio of the population where males hunting occurred was shifted towards females, but it evened over time with the reduction of hunting pressure. The adult sex ratio in the population without hunting and the chick sex ratios in both populations were even, suggesting that hunting acted as a mostly additive source of mortality.

AB  - Wildlife managers depend on accurate information regarding wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) survival patterns to properly manage turkey populations. Survival patterns of male Rio Grande wild turkeys (M. g. intermedia) have not been studied intensively. Wildlife managers in the Texas Panhandle, USA, and southwestern Kansas, USA, suspected that turkey populations were declining. From January 2000 through August 2002, we studied survival and movement of 107juvenile male and 115 adult male radiomarked Rio Grande wild turkeys on 4 study sites in the Texas Panhandle and southwestern Kansas. We predicted that males would experience lowest survival during spring and that there would be no difference in survival between age classes. We also predicted that greater male movement rates would lead to lower survival rates. Juvenile males had a higher annual survival rate (0.59 7 [95% Cl hereafter: 0. 4 78-0.716]) than adults (0.364 [0.257-0.4 72]). Juvenile male survival did not differ among seasons, with survival rates of 0.813 (0.736-0.891), 0.904 (0.837-0.9 72), and 0.917 (0.838-0.996) for spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Adult male turkey survival was higher during summer (0. 915 [0.859-0.972]) than during spring (0. 725 [0.651-0.799j), autumn (0.671 [0.536-0.8017), and winter (0. 792 [0.732-0.85 1]). Males had lower survival rates during seasons when long-distance movements were common. The annual survival rate for turkeys that moved to new core-use areas (0.383 [0.282-0,484]) was lower than that for turkeys that did not (0.535 [0.460-0.609]). Also, survival rates increased with time since relocation of core-use areas. Hunting accounted for 18.5% of all mortalities. However, most (80.7%) mortality was attributed to natural causes, mostly mammalian predation. We suspected most predation was the result of coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus). Managers in the northern portion of the natural range of Rio Grande wild turkeys should be aware of the presence of natural mortality factors that are evident in lightly hunted populations. Managers interested in increasing the survival of male Rio Grande wild turkeys should concentrate on efforts that will provide needed resources in close proximity to roosts.

AB  - We examine habitat use by hunting hen harriers Circus cyaneus at three study sites in Scotland to evaluate whether foraging patterns differ between sexes, sites, and stages of the breeding period. We modelled time spent hunting in focal plots as a function of habitat and nest proximity. Male hunting intensity (time spent hunting per hour of observation and km(2)) varied between sites and breeding periods, being lower during the nestling than the incubation period. Habitat use patterns were mostly consistent among study sites, which is important for developing species management recommendations applicable over the species' range. Males avoided improved grassland, and selected areas of mixed heather and rough grass (with an optimum at ca. 50% heather cover). The effect of nest proximity was small. In contrast, females hunted mainly within 300-500 In of the nest, with a small additive effect of vegetation cover, areas of fragmented heather being preferred. Habitat management to benefit foraging harriers will involve creating (or maintaining) mosaics of heather/grassland around nest areas. Additionally, it might be possible to manipulate habitat to reduce conflict in areas where harrier predation on red grouse is important by segregating areas holding highest grouse densities (with high heather cover) from those favoured for harrier foraging (heather-grass mosaics). However, it would be necessary to test whether these manipulations might also influence harrier nest distribution, an effect which could negate any benefits from this strategy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the most important human-wildlife conflicts in the world is that where predators are involved. Predators may compete with us for the same resources, such as game species. As a consequence, predators have been frequently controlled by game managers, which has negatively affected many predator populations worldwide. The understanding of human-wildlife conflicts requires a multidisplicinary framework that is rarely considered. We aim to evaluate the attitudes and behavior of game managers with regard to predator management in central Spain, as well as to explore factors that lead to these attitudes and behavior. Data were gathered through face to face interviews with game managers from 59 small-game hunting estates within central Spain. Predator control was employed in 90% of the estates, but control intensity was very variable among estates. Economic interests and perceptions about predators apparently influenced variation in control intensity. The main methods employed were cage-traps and shooting, but some illegal practices (e. g., leg-hold traps or snares without stopping devices) were also admittedly used for carnivores. Most managers considered that efficacy of legal methods for control of foxes (Vulpes vulpes) was very limited. Overall, nonselective methods, such as some types of snares, were more frequently employed in commercial than in noncommercial estates. Most managers believed that predators had an important effect on prey, and therefore that not doing it would lead to smaller hunting bags. Only managers from commercial hunting estates used stronger discourses such as that hunting would be impossible without carrying out predator control, which suggests that their tolerance for predators was lower than that of managers whose main motivation was not economic. Most managers considered that predator control was effective to reduce the number of predators, but only in the short term. Therefore, they highlighted the need of maintaining predator control every year. Our results highlight the important role that both social and economic factors (even stronger than ecological factors) play driving predator control, and therefore the need of incorporating these factors when making decisions to mitigate the human-predator conflict.

AB  - North American boreal nesting waterfowl (and their eggs and ducklings) share a number of generalist predators with small mammals and non-migratory birds that could indirectly link fluctuations in these coexisting prey. We surveyed pairs and broods to determine an index of productivity for lesser scaup Aythya affinis breeding near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. We also calculated a mallard Anas platyrhynchos productivity index for birds from northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Small mammal abundance was estimated by snap trapping rodents and by counting pellets of snowshoe hares Lepus americanus in the Yellowknife area. Because small mammal data were not available for the same area as mallard harvest survey data, correlation with an estimate of ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus harvest was used because small mammal abundance and grouse are known to correlate positively. We found a positive correlation between the abundance of rodents and lesser scaup productivity suggesting a prey switching relationship for predators between their main prey (rodents) and alternative prey (lesser scaup, eggs and ducklings). A negative correlation between snowshoe hare abundance and lesser scaup productivity was also found as well as a negative correlation between ruffed grouse abundance and mallard productivity. Negative correlations suggest a possible shared predation relationship, where changes in main prey abundance (hares) may cause a numerical response in predators that influences predation rates of shared alternative prey (ducks, eggs and ducklings). Although our conclusions are based on correlations, they indicate that a great deal of variation in boreal duck productivity might be explained by the indirect effects of coexisting prey abundance. Further work is needed to determine causal mechanisms contributing to these relationships, the effect of cycles in small mammal populations and the overall importance of top-down predator regulation for regulating duck productivity in boreal forest.

AB  - Quail hunting consists of a complex set of behaviors that involve humans, pointing dogs, and wild birds. The recent development of models known as Hunter-Covey Interface (HCI) theory provides an opportunity to analyze how we perceive, understand, and manage quail hunting. There are 2 groups of HCI models: static and dynamic. The static HCI model predicts daily hunting mortality based on the velocity of the hunt and area covered during a hunt. The dynamic HCI models estimate the probability of flushing a covey given a set of circumstances that revolve around the potential rate of which quail learn to avoid hunters. We quantified the variables required to test whether the static and dynamic models of HCI theory provide meaningful results. We used spatial data on hunting velocity and area covered during > 100 quail hunts, along with estimates of quail population density, mortality, and movements from 2 areas in south Texas, to evaluate output from HCI models. The static model predicted average daily harvest rates that ranged from 5 to 50 birds. This average is within the range of average daily bag of south Texas quail hunters in groups of 2-4. Output from the dynamic models suggested that quail populations on our study areas were subjected to relatively low hunting intensities with a corresponding low avoidance behavior and learning rate, which is a scenario that matched I of 4 predictions by Guthery (2002). We found it difficult to meet basic assumptions of HCI theory. For example, hunting pressure was potentially redundant, coveys were not always randomly distributed in space, and the extent to which quail are naive at the beginning of a hunting season was unknown. However, both the static and dynamic HCI models appeared robust to violation of these assumptions. Application of HCI theory may provide meaningful results that can be used to manage quail hunting pressure, optimize harvest, and sustain populations.

AB  - The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and West Virginia Division of Natural Resources conducted a band-recovery study on male eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) during 1989-1996. Our train objectives were to estimate survival and band-reporting rates and to determine whether longer fall hunting seasons resulted in lower male turkey survival. Length of fall turkey hunting season varied from zero to 9 weeks at 3 study areas, while spring hunting season was relatively constant at 4 or 5 weeks. We attached reward leg bands to 473 male wild turkeys. Effects of different fall seasons were evaluated using survival and band-reporting rates. We used program MARK to construct a series of models including hunting-season structure, age (juvenile or adult), year, and period (fall or winter-summer) effects to estimate survival and band-reporting rates and to evaluate the effects of length of fall hunting on survival and band-reporting rates. Annual survival rates in our 3 study areas (range = 0.24-0.27) were lower than roost studies. Survival estimates were significantly (P< 0.05) lower in the winter-summer (range = 0.16-0.18) than in the fall (range = 0.58-0.62). We found little difference in band-recovery estimates between age classes in the fall, but adults had significantly higher band-recovery estimates in the winter-summer. Male wild turkey mean annual survival did not decrease as fall hunting season length increased. In contrast, hand-recovery rates increased as the length of the fall season increased. If band-recovery estimates indexed hunting mortality, then hunting mortality increased as length of fall hunting season increased. Moreover, if band-recovery rates represented hunting mortality, then the constancy of survival estimates among areas with different lengths of fall hunting season, coupled with the pattern of band-recovery rates, suggest that fall hunting mortality is not additive for male wild turkeys in Virginia and West Virginia, USA.

AB  - For the first time, microsatellite loci were used to study the genetic structure in Alectoris chukar cypriotes. Four of the ten tested microsatellite loci were found to be polymorphic in 33 individuals from four regions of Cyprus. The differentiation test between all the pairs of samples gave non-differentiation exact P values in every case (P > 0.05). The posterior probability distribution on the number of source populations indicated only one population (P = 0.977); also, a high Bayes factor value (130.020) was obtained. Posterior co-assignment probabilities (measures of similarity) for all pairs of individuals ranged from 0.984 to 1. The global F-IS value was not found to be significant. A recent bottleneck of the Cypriot total partridge population is suggested and this is supported by a significant Wilcoxon test (P=0.031) under the Infinite Alleles Model (IAM) and shifted mode in the alleles frequencies distribution. The results suggest that all the individuals studied belong to only one randomly mating (panmictic) population, with low genetic variation and evidence of recent effective population size reduction (genetic bottleneck). A big hunting pressure exists on the island and about 200,000 captive-bred birds are released every year; these individuals are descendant from a small number of eggs collected in a small area of Cyprus in 1986 and this founder effect could explain the existence of a bottleneck and the low genetic variability.

AB  - In Finland, Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) populations have a history of serious decrease starting from the mid-20th century. The decline is temporally in line with the expansion of modern forestry practices that created major changes in the landscape. We used tetraonid route-censuses from 18 forestry board districts and Finnish forest inventories (data on forest stand structure) to analyze the decline in 1965-1988. We used information theoretical model selection to evaluate a set of log-linear second order auto-regressive models, allowing for spatially correlated process errors. The average trend throughout the country corresponded to an annual decline of 4.01% (mean of local trends) +/- 0.24% (SEM), parallel to a half-life of 17 years. The decline was surprisingly uniform throughout the country (SD = 1.01%) and most parsimoniously explained by a geographically constant log-linear trend. At the large scale of observation applied here, population trends could not be explained by the proportional increase of younger forest age classes (<40 years old and <80 years old, respectively). Our analysis does not support the hypothesis that the decline in Capercaillie numbers is due to changes in the forest age structure, but we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors behind the decline may have interacted with forestry in general. From a conservation point of view, we caution against over-emphasizing the role of forest age especially at large spatial scales, but leaning also on other research, we recommend that more management efforts would go into the preservation of the overall forest cover and the original physiognomy in single forest patches.

AB  - The fast intensification of agriculture affects many systems. In recent decades, traditional vineyards have been rapidly converted to trellis vineyards in Spain (the country with the largest vineyard surface worldwide) in an attempt to reduce harvesting costs and increase vine productivity. The implications of this modernization of vineyards on farmland biodiversity are still largely unknown. We studied 52 vineyards (26 traditional and 26 trellis) from June to September in south-western Spain, aiming to describe the effect of the modernization of goblet-shape traditional vineyards on vine structure and their management, as well as its effect on species? occurrence in vineyard plots. We applied hierarchical occurrence models to assess the occurrence probability of 10 bird species and two mammal species in traditional and trellis vineyard plots. Vineyard modernization involved taller vines (connected by metallic guide wires and poles by rows), greater distance between vine rows, bigger plot sizes, the systematic implementation of irrigation, and an application of fertilizers through the watering system (fertirrigation) in a third of studied vineyards. Other agrochemical treatments seemed to be equally used in both vineyard types. Due to the use of herbicides and frequent tilling, both types of vineyards showed low natural vegetation groundcover. Vineyard modernization had clear effects on fauna biodiversity in vineyard plots, with a higher occurrence in trellis vineyards of some species (rufous-tailed scrub-robin, European goldfinch, red-legged partridge, and house sparrow) and a higher occurrence of other species (European rabbit and European greenfinch) in traditional ones. Thus, vineyard modernization can drive a change in the community of birds and mammals that inhabit them. In addition, vineyard use by some species (particularly ground-dwelling ones) was strongly determined by the presence of arable land adjacent to the vineyard. These species may therefore use vineyards during summer because they provide water and/or better cover than harvested crops. Animals attracted to vineyards for water could be exposed to toxic doses of nitrates that are routinely applied through the watering system in a third of these. To maximize benefits for biodiversity, it would be advisable to manage modernization schemes in order to maintain landscape heterogeneity, with vineyards of both types combined with other agricultural systems, as well as higher proportions of natural vegetation surface cover.

AB  - Data on the breeding success of the pied flycatcher, which reflects the combined effects of various biotic and abiotic factors affecting the quality of the breeding habitat each year, could explain more than three quarters of the variation in the autumn population levels of woodland tetraonids (capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and black grouse T. tetrix) in a subalpine forest area in Lierne, central Norway, during the period 1986-1995. The applicability of a simple regression model is evaluated on the basis of the data from 1996. Much less time is required to collect these breeding parameters on the flycatcher from nest boxes than to obtain reasonably good population estimates for the tetraonid species themselves directly. Data on the production of pied flycatcher, collected well in advance of the shooting season, could be used to set bag limits for woodland tetraonids the following autumn. This might be used as a tool for sustainable harvest to avoid future over-exploitation of these species in years with predicted low production. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Impacts of climate change are already evident in ecosystems worldwide. High-latitude and altitude regions are at greatest risk because the effects of climate change are greater in these regions, and species from these areas have limited ability to track their climate envelopes. The Caucasian snowcock (Tetraogallus caucasicus) and the Caucasian grouse (Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi) are both high-altitude specialists that are endemic to a restricted range in the Caucasus mountains of Europe. Little research has been performed to determine the status of the populations or the potential impacts of climate change. We investigated how climate and land use change may impact both species in future and determined whether their life history traits may increase their vulnerability using a combined exposure and trait-based index. We compared several climate models, and in all instances, both species showed drastic range contractions although the extent of the contraction varied with each model. Traits like habitat specialism, ground nesting and incubation period meant that both species may be considered "most vulnerable" in the exposure and trait-based index. Given that both species already occur near the maximum elevations of the Caucasus, and that they lack any dispersal capabilities due to the isolation from alternative mountainous areas, research efforts need to be prioritized to improve our knowledge about their population status, to monitor future trends and to begin developing species action plans that conserve these endemic and iconic species of Europe. Both species are flagship and umbrella species and may serve as indicator species, their protection may therefore benefit a whole range of other species inhabiting this vulnerable Alpine ecosystem. Especially the Caucasian grouse has a high aesthetic value and is favoured by hunters in the region. The potential demise of this species may therefore also be negative for local communities.

AB  - Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations in Texas have been declining during the past several decades. Declines have been attributed to habitat loss, but other causes and potential contributing factors (e.g., parasites, disease) have been posited. Little is known about helminth parasites in bobwhites from Texas. Previous studies often used bobwhites collected during the hunting season, which only samples individuals that survive after the summer breeding season. Our objectives were to (1) assess the prevalence, intensity, and abundance of helminths in bobwhites from Fisher County, Texas, during an annual cycle; (2) identify which species are known to be pathogenic; and (3) determine whether infections are related to host age, sex, and season of collection. We collected 142 bobwhites during February-March 2010 (n = 37), August 2010 (n = 51), and December 2010-January 2011 (n = 54). We found 7 helminth species, of which 3 (Oxyspirura petrowi, Tetrameres pattersoni, and Dispharynx nasuta) are known to cause tissue damage to bobwhites. Aulonocephalus pennula was the most common (82% prevalence) and numerically abundant species (96% of all specimens). Prevalence and mean abundance of A. pennula, O. petrowi, and T. pattersoni were higher in adults than juveniles. Prevalence of A. pennula, O. petrowi, and T. pattersoni did not vary with host sex. Mean abundance of T. pattersoni was higher in females than males. Prevalence of A. pennula, O. petrowi, and T. pattersoni was lower in summer than early and late winter and was related to low infections in young juveniles. Our findings provide insight into helminth infection dynamics of Northern Bobwhites across an annual cycle.

AB  - In this paper, we present tabulations of annual game-animal harvests in Canaan Valley and Tucker County, WV, from several time periods. We present countywide harvest-data for 1923-2001 for Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer), 1969-2001 for Castor canadensis (Beaver), 1976-2001 for Lynx rufus (Bobcat), 1950-2001 for Ursus americanus (Black Bear), 1975-2001 for Martes pennanti (Fisher), and 1940-2001 for Meleagris gallopavo (Wild Turkey). Annual numbers of animals harvested in Canaan Valley have increased steadily during the past 75 years since the establishment of modern regulations. Interpretations of reported harvest data are difficult because of changes in extrinsic factors that affect hunting and trapping pressure and success. The only game animal for which harvest levels are positively correlated with population density is White-tailed Deer. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine by examining the harvest numbers whether populations of game animals have increased, decreased, or remained stable.

AB  - In this study, we assessed habitat preferences and temporal activity patterns of caracal (Caracal caracal) and several possible prey species in Koyceiz Wildlife Development Reserve, south-western Turkey. We investigated whether wild goat (Capra aegagrus) is indeed the main prey of caracal and if there is evidence for excessive caracal predation on this ungulate as previously stated by researchers, wildlife wardens and hunters. Results of this 2249 camera trap-day survey revealed a high habitat segregation between caracal and wild goat (Pianka's O=0.2) and very high overlap between caracal and other prey species such as brown hare (Lepus europaeus), field mice (Apodemus spp.), chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) (Pianka's O=0.8-1.0). Wild goats preferred steep slopes (Chesson's =0.85) and associated narrow valley bottoms, whereas caracals preferred high flatland forests (Chesson's =0.95). The overlap coefficients in temporal activity patterns of caracal and wild goat ((1)=0.50), and caracal and other prey species were moderate ((1)=0.40-0.59), and did not indicate strict predator-prey relationships based on temporal activities. The results of this study do not support a caracal diet based mainly on wild goat, due to their mostly spatial and partially temporal segregation. Other smaller prey species such as brown hare, rodents and chukar partridge can serve as better prey options due to their continuous presence in caracal habitat throughout the day and year.

AB  - Annual fluctuations of northern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) populations often are attributed to high winter mortality. However, studies conducted in agricultural environments have demonstrated that seasonal survival can be highest during winter, suggesting other factors are more important to annual population change. We examined survival and reproduction of female eastern wild turkeys in south-central New York during 1990-93 and conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the relative importance of demographic parameters to annual population change. Seasonal survival rates (n = 238) were 0.800 for spring, 0.855 for summer, 0.834 for fall, and 0.873 for winter. Fall survival rates varied by years (P < 0.01) and were higher during years of above average hen success. Annual survival rates averaged 0.498, and crude annual mortality rates ((M) over cap) averaged 0.321 for predation and 0.117 for poaching, hunting, and wounding combined. Subadult females had lower nesting rates (P = 0.002, n = 201), lower renesting rates (P = 0.001, n = 115), and lower hen success rates (P = 0.02, n = 196) than adult females. Nest success averaged 37.9% (n = 232) and was highest (P = 0.005) during years with average to below average May rainfall. We observed annual variation in nest success (P = 0.001), hen success (P = 0.003), and hatching rates (P = 0.04). Poult survival averaged 40.0% (n = 605) and did not vary among years (P = 0.73). Nest success was the primary factor contributing to annual population change. We suggest that annual fluctuations of northern populations in mixed agricultural and forested environments rarely result from variability of annual survival and may result from variability of annual nest success and poult survival. Northern populations subjected to infrequent severe winters in mixed agricultural and forested environments likely would benefit more from enhancement of nesting and brood-rearing habitat.

AB  - Artificial drainage of wetlands can increase nest predation risk through landscape changes that support higher predator numbers or expose the nests. We experimentally studied how nest predation responds to reversing such pressures by forested wetland restoration and predator removal. We studied two pairs of experimental and control landscapes in north-eastern (NE) and southwestern (SW) Estonia, where mammalian mesopredators were specifically hunted. Within the SW landscape pair, we simultaneously had a replicated before-after-control-impact experiment of restoring sparse pine wetlands for the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) by ditch blocking and partial cutting. Three years after the habitat manipulations, we found drastically increased predation rates of artificial ground nests across those restoration blocks (including uncut stands there), with no compensating effect of the predator removal. However, outside the experimental blocks of the SW predator removal landscape, higher reproductive success of the hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) and capercaillie was recorded after the removal; there was also evidence of improved landscape-scale survival of artificial nests in both the SW and NE removal landscapes. These results indicate that wetland restoration can suppress grouse reproduction at least in the short term, but predator control can mitigate these effects on a broader scale. Restoring habitat quality in forested wetlands is a complex task that requires long-term studies of alternatives and precautionary approaches.

AB  - Accurate estimation and monitoring of wildlife population trends is foundational to evidence-based conservation. Here, we use hierarchical modelling to estimate population trends for six species of management interest (coyotes; red foxes, white-tailed deer, gray foxes; eastern wild turkey, and bobcats) while accounting for observation error from a long-term camera trap survey conducted across the State of New York. We were able to detect population level trends in occurrence and abundance and produce spatially explicit predictions for all six species using a combination of single-species occupancy models and Royle-Nichols models. Coyote (mean lambda = 1.22, 95 % CI = 0.85-1.82) and red fox (mean lambda = 1.17, 95 % CI = 0.95-1.46) populations were widely distributed with stable populations across the sampling period from 2014 to 2021. White-tailed deer populations were highly abundant and displayed an increasing population trend (mean lambda = 1.85, 95 % CI = 1.54-2.10). Eastern wild turkey occupancy remained low across the state despite displaying a slight increase in occupancy over the sampling period (mean psi = 0.16, 95 % CI = 0.07-0.25). Gray fox occupancy was also low (mean psi = 0.22, 95 % CI = 0.12-0.29), consistent with growing concerns over the species across North America. Despite recent recoveries elsewhere, bobcat populations in New York State displayed very low occupancy (mean psi = 0.07, 95 % CI = 0.02-0.12), highlighting the necessity of monitoring to inform conservation action. We provide empirically supported management implications for each species and demonstrate the efficacy of long-term camera trapping to provide robust evidence on population trends while accounting for imperfect detections, over scales meaningful to species management and conservation.

AB  - The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks utilize data from turkey hunter observations and brood surveys from across the state to manage wild turkey Meleagris gallopavo populations. Since 1995, hunters have collected gobbling and jake observation data, while the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks' personnel and cooperating wildlife managers of several natural resource agencies throughout the state have collected brood survey data. Both sources of data serve to forecast poult recruitment and gobbling activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate if these data can serve as a viable predictor of gobbling activity. We used three mixed models to investigate the relationship between the number of jakes observed per hour of hunting 1 y prior and the total number of poults per hens 2 y prior (model 1), number of gobblers heard per hour of hunting and the number of jakes observed per hour of hunting 1 y prior (model 2), the number of gobblers heard per hour of hunting and the total number poults per total hens observed 2 y prior (model 3) using data from 1995 to 2008 among five wild turkey management regions encompassing the state. We incorporated region as a random effect to account for spatial variation. We found the number of jakes observed per hour of hunting 1 y prior correlated with the total number of poults per total hens observed 2 y prior. We also found the number of gobblers heard per hour of hunting correlated with the number of jakes observed per hour of hunting 1 y prior. Additionally, we found that the total poults per total hens observed 2 y prior was correlated to the number of gobblers heard per hour of hunting. Our results show promise for using indices of gobbling activity, jake observations, and brood surveys to estimate gobbling activity.

AB  - China is one of the countries with the richest bird biodiversity in the world. Among the 1372 Chinese birds, 146 species are considered threatened and three species are regionally extinct according to the officially released China Biodiversity Red List in 2015. Here, we conducted the first extensive analysis to systematically investigate the patterns and processes of extinction and threat in Chinese birds. We addressed the following four questions. First, is extinction risk randomly distributed among avian families in Chinese birds? Second, which families contain more threatened species than would be expected by chance? Third, which species traits are important in determining the extinction risk in Chinese birds using a multivariate phylogenetic comparative approach? Finally, is the form of the relationship between traits additive or nonadditive (synergistic)? We found that the extinction risk of Chinese birds was not randomly distributed among taxonomic families. The families that contained significantly more threatened species than expected were the hornbills, cranes, pittas, pheasants and hawks and eagles. We obtained eleven species traits that are commonly hypothesized to influence extinction risk from the literature: body size, clutch size, trophic level, mobility, habitat specificity, geographical range size, nest type, nest site, flocking tendency, migrant status and hunting vulnerability. After phylogenetic correction, model selection based on Akaike's information criterion identified the synergistic interaction between body size and hunting vulnerability as the single best correlate of extinction risk in Chinese birds. Our results suggest that, in order to be effective, priority management efforts should be given both to certain extinction-prone families, particularly the hornbills, pelicans, cranes, pittas, pheasants and hawks and eagles, and to bird species with large body size and high hunting vulnerability.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has potential as a biofuel feedstock for ethanol production on marginal soils not suitable for row crop production. Further, it is hypothesized that legumes may be interseeded into switchgrass to increase available soil nitrogen (N) and enhance switchgrass yields. Therefore the primary objective was to identify compatible legume species for intercropping with lowland switchgrass and determine if biomass yields and forage quality can be improved. Four cool-and two warm-season legume species were compared to application of 67 and 134 kg N ha(-1) (59.8 and 119.6 lb N ac(-1)) during 2009 and 2010 over a range of soils at three research and education centers in Tennessee. Cool-season legumes were alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.), and warm-season legumes included Illinois bundle flower (Desmanthus illinoensis L.) and partridge pea (Chamaechrista fasciculata L.). Legumes were evaluated for establishment (plant densities) and their effects on switchgrass yield and forage quality under a one-cut biomass (single, postdormancy biofuel) and an integrated two-cut (biomass/forage [preanthesis]) system. In the one-cut system, switchgrass yields (16.6 Mg ha(-1) [6.7 tn ac(-1)]) from the current recommended rate (67 kg N ha(-1) [59.8 lb N ac(-1)]) exceeded (p < 0.05) legume treatment yields (average 13.5 Mg ha(-1) [5.5 tn ac(-1)]). In the integrated harvest system, switchgrass yields from red (13.4 Mg ha(-1) [5.4 tn ac-1]) and crimson clover (12.8 Mg ha(-1) [5.2 tn ac(-1)]) intercrops were not different from 67 kg N ha(-1) (14.5 Mg ha(-1) [5.9 tn ac(-1)]). Crude protein levels were greater (p < 0.05) for 134 kg N ha(-1) (119.6 lb N ac(-1)), compared to legume intercrops (except red clover). Partridge pea showed promise as a warm-season legume that can be grown compatibly with switchgrass for up to two years. Therefore, compatible legume-intercrop candidates, such as partridge pea and red clover, may enhance switchgrass yield and forage quality while displacing synthetic N in integrated biofuel/forage systems, but need to be further investigated in efforts to reduce nitrate (NO3) leaching and emissions from fertilizing.

AB  - Predation can limit bird populations, especially in ground-nesting and colonial species. Solutions are usually available to reduce the impacts of predation if the predator is non-native or not legally protected (e.g. predator control or exclusion). However, when the predator is protected by law (e.g. raptors) potential solutions are limited. If predator and prey are both species of conservation concern this can bring the conservation of these species into conflict. Diversionary feeding (DF) is a potential solution, whereby predators are provided with food to reduce their motivation to hunt. The efficacy of DF has rarely been tested thus, in this paper, we test the efficacy of DF to reduce predation by kestrels, Falco tinninculus, a protected and declining raptor, on little tern chicks, Sternula albifrons, a protected seabird, within an internationally important colony in eastern England. We used a 17-year dataset of annual estimates of little tern productivity and counts of kestrel predation events to compare years with and without DF (DF = 6 years). During a four-year period of more intensive monitoring efforts, where we employed DF at focal kestrel nests in alternate years, we quantified the rates of kestrel predation at the colony and prey provisioning rates at kestrel nests. Predation rates were 47% lower and productivity of little terns doubled in years when kestrels were fed. Intensive monitoring showed that predation rates by kestrels at the colony were 88% lower in the two years when kestrels were fed. Provisioning rates of all wild prey and little tern prey, was 3.4 and 6.2 times lower in DF years and the likelihood of little tern chicks being provisioned at nests was lower when alternative wild prey were provisioned. DF is an effective tool to reduce predation and increase productivity of little tern colonies threatened by kestrel predation. The magnitude of these effects on lithe tern productivity was sufficient to promote population increases. Raptor conservation has resulted in increasing populations of many species and it is expected that predator-prey conflicts are likely to increase. DF could be an important tool to manage these conservation issues, but further tests of the efficacy in different predator-prey systems will be needed.

AB  - Although research has advanced methods for clarifying factors that relate to customer satisfaction, they have not been embraced by leisure researchers. Using results from a survey of wild turkey hunters, we applied traditional and revised importance-performance (IPA/RIPA), importance-grid analysis (IGA), and penalty-reward-contrast analysis (PRCA) to examine how activity-specific factors influenced satisfaction. Results suggested differences between the explicit and implicit importance of factors related to turkey hunting. Opportunities to kill turkeys were explicitly rated as less important than seeing, hearing, or calling in turkeys, but opportunities for harvest had relatively higher levels of implicit importance. PRCA identified "calling turkeys in" and "hearing gobbling" as minimum requirements that cause dissatisfaction if not fulfilled, but do not provide satisfaction, whereas "seeing turkeys" and an "opportunity to kill a turkey" related to both satisfaction and dissatisfaction. RIPA, IGA, and PRCA could provide valuable insights about factors that may improve satisfaction for leisure participants.

AB  - Lead is highly toxic for wildlife, with pernicious consequences especially in long-lived predators. The causes of lead ammunition ingestion in Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) and its effects on breeding success were studied in one of the most important populations of this endangered species in Europe. Regurgitated pellets belonging to different pairs from 2004 to 2014 were analyzed, both in the breeding (1363 pellets from 12 territories) and non-breeding (172 pellets from 9 territories) seasons. From these territories, 57 molted feathers to study lead contamination were analyzed, and breeding success was monitored for 41 breeding attempts. The occurrence of lead shots in pellets was detected using X-ray photographs. Pellets were also used to describe eagle diet. Lead shots in pellets were present in 83.3% of the territories. The frequency of occurrence of lead shots in pellets (2.81% in spring and 1.31% in autumn) was primarily related to the consumption of red-legged partridge in the breeding season (when partridges are hunted from blinds using calling lures), and secondarily to rabbit consumption in the non-breeding season (coinciding with the main hunting season). Thus, our results indicate that injured small-game were the main source of lead contamination in the Bonelli's eagle. For the first time for a raptor species, a positive relationship between the frequency of occurrence of lead shots in pellets and lead concentration in eagles' feathers has been documented. Lead concentration in feathers (mean +/- SD: 816 +/- 426 mu g kg(-1), with no sex-related differences) was high for a species that rarely eats carrion or aquatic birds ( the main prey-related lead source for raptors). This had negative effects on breeding success, which could jeopardize Bonelli's eagles in other European populations that are sustained by juvenile dispersal from the study population. Our work shows that some game modalities pose a potential threat to endangered raptors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined retention of butt-end aluminum leg bands on Rio Grande wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) captured in Texas and Kansas, USA, 2000-2009. We examined 187 recaptured or harvested radiotagged wild turkeys to determine band retention and modeled band retention with Program MARK. We did not detect differences in band retention among age and gender classes or that band retention probability was time dependent. We estimated monthly probability of band retention was 0.990 (SE = 0.002). Band retention probability was 0.971 (SE = 0.006) at 3 months post-banding and 0.864 (SE = 0.028) at 15 months post-banding. Butt-end aluminum leg band retention was not 100% for wild turkeys marked during our work; however, our band retention rates were 3.7-5.7 times greater than described previously.

AB  - The importance of western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) DC.) in the diet of bobwhites (Colinus virginianus Merr.) and their high dietary requirement for essential amino acids prompted us to explore the use of disking and fertilization (nitrogen and phosphorus) to improve its nutritional quality on deep, unfertile, sandy-soil rangelands in western Oklahoma.  Fertilization (55 kg N ha-1, 56 kg P ha-1 as diammonium phosphate) of disk strips did not readily increase seed production of western ragweed.  Fertilizer had no detectable effect on nutritional quality of seeds, which contained an average of 13% crude protein and 21% fat.  Conflicting results reported on the effect of fertilizer on the quality of plant proteins within the literature could be attributable to differences of climate and soils, growth habits of different plant species, type and rates of fertilizers, and stages of maturity when plants are harvested for analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND : Previous studies have identified the consumption of country foods (hunted/harvested foods from the land) as the primary exposure source of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) in Arctic communities. However, identifying the specific foods associated with PFAA exposures is complicated due to correlation between country foods that are commonly consumed together. METHODS : We used venous blood sample data and food frequency questionnaire data from the Qanuilirpitaa? ("How are we now?") 2017 (Q2017) survey of Inuit individuals >= 16 y of age residing in Nunavik ( n = 1,193). Adaptive elastic net, a machine learning technique, identified the most important food items for predicting PFAA biomarker levels while accounting for the correlation among the food items. We used generalized linear regression models to quantify the association between the most predictive food items and six plasma PFAA biomarker levels. The estimates were converted to percent changes in a specific PFAA biomarker level per standard deviation increase in the consumption of a food item. Models were also stratified by food type (market or country foods). RESULTS : Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) were associated with frequent consumption of beluga misirak (rendered fat) [14.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 10.3%, 18.9%; 14.6% (95% CI: 10.1%, 19.0%)], seal liver [9.3% (95% CI: 5.0%, 13.7%); 8.1% (95% CI: 3.5%, 12.6%)], and suuvalik (fish roe mixed with berries and fat) [6.0% (95% CI: 1.3%, 10.7%); 7.5% (95% CI: 2.7%, 12.3%)]. Beluga misirak was also associated with higher concentrations of perfluorohexanesulphonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), albeit with lower percentage changes. PFHxS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and PFNA followed some similar patterns, with higher levels associated with frequent consumption of ptarmigan [6.1% (95% CI: 3.2%, 9.0%); 5.1% (95% CI: 1.1%, 9.1%); 5.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 9.0%)]. Among market foods, frequent consumption of processed meat and popcorn was consistently associated with lower PFAA exposure. CONCLUSIONS : Our study identifies specific food items contributing to environmental contaminant exposure in Indigenous or small communities relying on local subsistence foods using adaptive elastic net to prioritize responses from a complex food frequency questionnaire. In Nunavik, higher PFAA biomarker levels were primarily related to increased consumption of country foods, particularly beluga misirak , seal liver, suuvalik , and ptarmigan. Our results support policies regulating PFAA production and use to limit the contamination of Arctic species through long-range transport.

AB  - Helmeted guineafowl Numida meleagris populations in KwaZulu-Natal which once provided some of the best gamebird hunting in Africa have declined significantly over the past 15 years. This study investigated, by means of a questionnaire survey, the apparent collapse of guineafowl populations in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and Drakensberg regions, and the potential agricultural causes thereof. The number of pesticides used, their toxicity levels, and the proportion of land under cultivation can be used to discriminate significantly between extinct and declining versus stable and increasing guineafowl populations, being higher in the former populations. These results suggest that efficient, intensive farming practices have not only compressed the period in the farming year over which food is available to the guineafowl, but also reduced the suitability of farmlands as wildlife habitat. Remedies are suggested to resuscitate declining populations and optimize their long-term preservation for potential sustainable utilization. Recommended management actions include the judicious use of pesticides and the creation of suitable habitat at the landscape scale.

AB  - Forty-three flocks of Eastern Wild Turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), 26 of which contained greater than or equal to 1 bird with a functional radio, were used to compare the number of flocks and number of birds counted in winter by aerial observers with known numbers on the ground. Research was conducted in an experimental turkey hunting zone (THZ) where Turkeys were intensively monitored as part of a population dynamics study. Helicopter-based counts (H) of total flocks and total birds avenged 86% and 80%, respectively, of ground-based (G) counts in the THZ where H/G comparisons were made in 1989, 1991, and 1993. Turkey densities adjusted by the 0.80 H/G ratio based on the total number of birds counted by helicopter-and ground-based observers in the experimental THZ, varied from 0.9 to 11.0/km(2) during 12 helicopter counts in 5 THZs during 1989-1994. Turkey densities were correlated (P = 0.025) with the spring harvest density derived from the number of gobblers killed/km(2) of forest from mandatory registration. Helicopter surveys of Wild Turkeys are most applicable in areas dominated by deciduous woodlands and agricultural crop fields where snow depths greater than or equal to 15 cm occur.

AB  - Knowledge of density-dependent processes is regarded as important for making decisions on the management of wildlife populations. Using published data on ungulates and upland game birds, we discuss density-dependent effects on population growth, harvest management under the logistic model, and management to increase or decrease survival and production. Empirical data show density-dependent growth for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), although the logistic model provided, at best, an approximation of growth. Managing harvest according to logistic theory is rare for ungulates and upland game; we suspect this owes to scarce data on population growth and complexity in density-dependent processes. Under density dependence, managing to increase production or survival may be self-defeating because an increase in 1 demographic variable entails a decrease in the other for sustaining populations (??=?1). The problem can be addressed by providing space for population growth (??>?1), at least until growth re-establishes the density-dependent response (??=?1). (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - 1. Fields left fallow after harvest (i.e. stubble fields) support high wintering densities of many species of granivorous bird. We examined correlates of use by eight such species of different types of intensively managed wheat and barley stubble fields, organic wheat fields and set-aside fields on mixed lowland farmland in central England. Field occupancy was studied in relation to the physical characteristics of fields and seed abundance.        2. Higher seed abundance was associated with greater occupancy by linnet Carduelis cannabina, grey partridge Perdix perdix, chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus and corn bunting Miliaria calandra. Larger areas of bare earth within stubble fields were associated with greater occupancy by linnet, yellowhammer, reed bunting and corn bunting, but lower occupancy by woodpigeon Columba palumbus.        3. On conventional intensively farmed sites, seed abundance and area of bare earth were significantly greater on barley stubbles than on wheat stubbles.        4. Seed numbers fell throughout the winter in all stubble types, although reductions were greatest on intensive barley stubbles, intermediate on intensive wheat stubble and lowest on undersown organic wheat stubbles.        5. Within fields occupied by linnets, areas used for feeding had significantly greater quantities of seeds known to be important in their diet. Feeding areas also had a greater area of bare earth than randomly selected 'non-feeding areas'.        6. Linnets and reed buntings were rarely found on fields where densities of weed seeds important in their diets fell below 250 seeds m(-2). In autumn, yellowhammers and grey partridges rarely fed on fields where cereal grain density was below 50 m(-2). However, in spring, both species fed on these fields irrespective of grain density, perhaps indicating a switch to other food sources.        7. We suggest that land managers wishing to maximize the value of overwinter stubble fields for granivorous birds locate such fields where there is a substantial natural regeneration of weed flora and where previous cropping (e.g. barley) is likely to offer a sparse stubble with substantial areas of bare ground.

AB  - Although many studies have investigated the feeding habits of Palaearctic raptors, few have analysed non-breeding populations during dispersal. Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata), a threatened species in Western Europe, has a relatively long and critical dispersal period. We studied feeding habits, prey selection, and the influence of prey density on floater abundance in this species during its dispersal period in southern Spain. Differences were found between the diet of floaters and that of the closest breeding populations. Diet diversity was rather low for floaters, with European wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) being the main prey and the only prey positively selected. Moreover, the number of floater Bonelli's eagles observed in the dispersal areas was positively associated with rabbit abundance. Other prey included red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) and pigeons (Columba sp.). We propose measures to match suitable prey availability for floater eagles in settlement areas and the use of such areas as human hunting fields.

AB  - Results are presented from 14 surveys in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. Forest fragments are ranked by occurrence of key species of primates, duikers and birds. Taken together, the West Kilombero Scarp forests, Mwanihana and Udzungwa Scarp have presumably viable populations of four Udzungwa endemics with the following total population estimates: Udzungwa colobus (Procolobus badius gordonorum 15,400), Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus sanjei 1350), Udzungwa forest partridge (Xenoperdix udzungwensis 3700) and rufous-winged sunbird (Nectarinia rufipennis 6850). The mountains are also strongholds for Swynnerton's robin (Swynnertonia swynnertoni), Iringa akalat (Sheppardia lowei), dapple-throat (Arcanator orostruthus), white-winged apalis (Apalis chariessa), Usambara weaver (Ploceus nicolli), and for Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix). Appropriate village based conservation measures need to address questions about sustainable forest use, hunting and possibilities for forest regeneration in large tracts of fire-maintained grasslands.

AB  - The conflicts associated with the return of flagship species and the consequences of exotic species invasion have been extensively assessed, but there is a lack of information about conflicts derived from the colonization of common native species. The present study aims to assess the perception of different profiles of stakeholders regarding the spread of a native medium-sized mammal found in Spain: the case of the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon L), which can compromise the conservation of rabbit and red-legged partridge and the economic activity of rural areas. Using a sample of 116 landowners and 251 hunters and multiple bounded uncertainty choice data, we analyzed the stakeholders' perception of predators, the stakeholders' preferences of different management measures for predator control, and the role of local people for controlling the Egyptian mongoose.

AB  - We explored the views held by Spanish hunters on hunting, and assessed how these views varied according to participant characteristics and whether or not the responses were made public via a hunter's magazine. Hunters expressed many positive values in relation to hunting, but were critical of their own community as well as other stakeholders. Spanish hunters felt misunderstood and even attacked by society at large. There was also a widespread negative perception of the future of hunting. The frequency of references to different opinions varied between anonymous and public respondents and in relation to age group. Participants who expressed their opinions publicly mentioned the ecological values of hunting more frequently, were more critical towards their own community, and viewed the future of hunting more positively than anonymous participants. This may indicate an intended projected positive image; namely, Spanish hunters may publicly emphasize those views that improve their position in society.

AB  - Movements, roosting activities, and home-range characteristics of adult and subadult male Merriam's wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo merriami) were studied in south-central Colorado during spring 1986, 1988, and 1989. Adult males moved 5.3 +/- 3.8 (SD) km from winter ranges to spring breeding areas and had an average harmonic mean spring home range size of 5.2 +/- 3.3 km2. Subadult males moved farther (8.7 +/- 3.1 km, P = 0.03) and occupied larger (12.3 +/- 4.9 km2, P < 0.01) harmonic mean home ranges than adults. Minimum convex polygon home ranges for both age classes were > 100% larger (P < 0.01) than harmonic mean home ranges. The median distance between morning and evening roosts used on the same day was 996 m for subadults and 1,074 m for adults. Median distances between consecutive roost sites increased during the hunting season compared to preseason and postseason periods. Subadults returned to the same roosts more often (29%) than adults (19%). Departure and roosting times during the hunting season indicated shooting hours should start at sunrise and end 0.5 h before sunset to discourage roost shooting and promote ethical hunting practices.

AB  - Twelve ancient artifacts or fragmented feather samples recovered from melting alpine ice patches in southern Yukon were analyzed in order to identify the species of birds associated with the ice patches or used on weapons recovered from these sites. The identification of bird species used by ancient hunters as long ago as 4500 BP enhances our insight into the customs, culture, and sophistication of life at that time. Downy feather barbs were found on two samples and microscopically identified as duck (Anatidae) and falcon (Falconidae). Further examination and comparisons using museum specimens resulted in a total of six identifications: Anatidae, eagle (Aquila or Haliaeetus), gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), and northern flicker (Colaptes auratus luteus). Three of the feather samples were complete enough to show apparent modification, or notching, along the feather shaft. The identification of non-game birds such as gyrfalcon and eagles, together with evidence of possible worked or notched feathers, indicates that as long as 4500 years ago, Subarctic hunters selected feathers not only for their utility in fletching, but also possibly for symbolic or decorative purposes.

AB  - Biodiversity declines in Southeast Asia have led to predictions that many vertebrate species will become extinct within 50 years. Examples of quantified deterioration in species status remain scarce, however. The Southeast Asian geographical range of the Endangered Green peafowl is still contracting due to hunting pressure and habitat disturbance. In Vietnam, the main population lies in the southcentral region with a relatively high density reported in 1998. The aim of this study was to assess the species' current status in Yok Don and Cat Tien National Parks, which are thought to contain the most important Vietnamese populations. We used line and point transects to investigate the density and analyze habitat selection and effects of human activity. The Yok Don population has decreased sharply during the past 15 years, while in Cat Tien, the estimated density was higher. Animals were most numerous close to water sources and lowest where cattle numbers were highest and ground vegetation cover absent. Here we document a significant negative population change in a previously widespread vertebrate species. Although comparisons of population data over long periods are rare, we demonstrate that taking advantage of opportunities to resurvey species can quantify population declines. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Big game populations are being raised in areas characterized by different land uses and are being managed under a wide range of circumstances which might influence their population densities and structure. However, the consideration of explanatory variables related to management activities is not generally explicitly considered in game population models. This paper focuses on how estate owners' management objectives and strategies influence red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) hunting yields. We study red deer harvest in 187 hunting estates in Andalusia (Spain) and use both ecological and management predictors to describe capture levels in each hunting estate. We have found that the main land use of the area where red deer are being raised, the type of hunting holder, and the long-term management strategies (such as fencing and the hunting practices implemented) significantly explain red deer hunting bag, which is often used as proxy of population abundance. Therefore, ecological variables alone are not always sufficient to determine big game harvests. We provide empirical support that reinforces the relevance of considering humans and their long-term decisions when trying to interpret wildlife harvests, populations, and trends. We urge scientists and technicians to incorporate human aims in the game species distribution models and resource user decision models, particularly when game populations are being intensively managed.

AB  - Estimating abundance and growth of animal populations are central tasks in ecology and natural resource management. Removal models for estimating abundance have a long history in applied ecology, and recent developments provided hierarchical extensions that account for spatially replicated sampling and heterogeneous capture probabilities. Measurement error is common to removal data collected from many broad-scale monitoring programs, however, and a general framework for population assessment using removal data in the presence of measurement error is lacking. We developed a hierarchical framework for estimating abundance and population trends from removal experiments that are replicated in space and time that accommodates measurement error, as well as heterogeneity in capture probability and animal density. We describe the model for variable-effort removal sampling and use it to estimate region-specific abundance and population trends for wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) in Michigan, USA. We used a Bayesian approach for estimation and inference and fit models using daily hunter harvest and effort estimates collected over 5 management regions for 14 annual hunting seasons. Our analyses provide evidence for spatially heterogeneous capture probabilities among regions and turkey densities that were heterogeneous in both space and time, and show that populations increased slightly over the study. Our framework provides a general approach for population assessment using removal data that are collected over broad scales in resource management contexts (e.g., animal harvesting), facilitating formal abundance estimation instead of reliance on unverified indices for tracking populations of managed species. Thus, we provide a useful tool for monitoring programs to assess populations over broad scales, and therefore inform decision makers about population status at spatial scales similar to those for which regulatory decisions are made.

AB  - Historical transport of ore concentrate over a 50-mile haul road from the Red Dog zinc/lead mine in northwest Alaska to a seaport has been associated with elevated lead levels on moss growing near the road and with concerns about the safety of subsistence foods. As part of a comprehensive evaluation of potential impacts to human health and the environment from metals released during overland transport of ore concentrate, a human health risk assessment was conducted. Exposure to site-related metals through subsistence food consumption, water ingestion, and incidental soil ingestion was evaluated for three scenarios: child subsistence use, adult subsistence use, and adult combined occupational and subsistence use. The risk assessment used local subsistence food consumption data and subsistence harvest area information, along with metal concentrations from soil, water, caribou, fish, ptarmigan, berries, and sourdock collected on or near the road and port. The results, along with other lines of evidence, indicate that risks associated with subsistence food consumption and harvest activities are well within acceptable limits for each scenario and that subsistence foods remain safe to eat. Additionally, human health risks are not elevated even when data from restricted areas of the road and port are included.

AB  - We studied survival and cause-specific mortality of radio-marked capercaillie Tetrao urogallus females relative to habitat type in northern Sweden during 2000-2004. Our high-mountain area (1,600 km(2)) consisted of the alpine transition zone from Norway spruce Picea abies-dominated forest, mountain birch Betula pubescens and alpine heath. Our low-mountain areas consisted of two forest areas (300 and 160 km(2)) dominated by Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and characterised by more intensive forestry than the first-mentioned area. Predation was the most common cause of mortality in both the high-mountain (70%) and low-mountain (90%) areas. We attributed 10% of mortality in both areas to hunting. Collisions with cars and power lines were only documented in the high-mountain area. A Cox-proportional regression model stratified by year suggested that hazard was lower for yearlings and birds using low-mountain areas, but these estimates were associated with large uncertainties. Pooling all individuals showed an average annual survival probability of 0.68 (0.62-0.75; 95% CI), with no tendency for hazard to vary among seasons. Because survival of females was comparable to those reported in other studies and the harvest mortality was low, we suggest that the capercaillie population in the Swedish high-mountain region does not need any changes in the present management strategy.

AB  - Early successional habitat (ESH), which is important to many game species, is declining throughout the Northeast United States. In New York State, management agencies are increasing efforts to manage for ESH, but such efforts require support from key stakeholders. We sought to understand the factors influencing such support among hunting license holders, and a subsample specializing in woodcock hunting, who use Wildlife Management Areas. Using structural equation modeling, we found significant direct and indirect relationships between type of hunter, hunting avidity, place attachment, and support for ESHM actions. Our findings suggest that to build support for habitat management, communications should focus on the benefits to the place, and emphasize management actions for wildlife species hunters are pursuing. Increased habitat from this type of management should lead to larger populations of game species, which could increase hunter satisfaction and perhaps increase the number of hunters interested in hunting for these species.

AB  - The ecological implications of coyote Canis latrans colonization of the eastern USA have drawn considerable interest from land managers and the general public. The ability to predict how these ecosystems, which have lacked larger predators for decades, would respond to the invasion of this highly adaptable species needs an understanding of coyote foraging behavior given local resource availability. Therefore, we examined the diet of coyotes in a longleaf pine Pinus palustrus ecosystem from 2007-2012. We examined 673 coyote scats collected on the Joseph W. Jones Ecological Research Center in southwestern Georgia. We observed considerable seasonality in coyote use of rodents, white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, rabbits and vegetation. Coyotes exploited anthropogenic food sources, particularly waste peanuts Arachis hypogaea, during the fall and winter when native soft mast was not available. Adult white-tailed deer were consumed during every month and was not limited to the pulse of carrion availability from hunter-harvested animals, suggesting the use of adult white-tailed deer may not be restricted to scavenging in this system. We found mesomammals, including armadillos Dasypus novemcinctus, raccoons Procyon lotor, Virginia opossums Didelphis viginiana, bobcats Lynx rufus, grey foxes Urocyon cineroargenteus and striped skunks Mephitis mephitis in approximately 18% of coyote scats from January-August. On our site, and some adjacent properties, the use of predator trapping focused primarily on Virginia opossum, raccoon, coyote, bobcat and gray fox, to increase northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus production may have resulted in increased use of mesomammals through scavenging. We offer evidence that coyote colonization may alter food web dynamics in longleaf pine ecosystems through depredation of white-tailed deer and by influencing the mesomammal guild through direct predation and competition for rodents, rabbits, carrion and soft mast.

AB  - Environmental variation in time and space generates complex patterns in the spatial structure of temporally covarying populations. Accounting for spatial population structure is important for sustainable management and harvest, but there is a need for a better understanding of the many mechanisms affecting the spatial structure of populations. In the large-scale research project SUSTAIN, detailed long-term data from several taxa within the boreal and Arctic ecosystems were used to address key research questions about spatial population structure. Here, we synthesise the main findings from these studies. Because nearby populations experience similar environmental variation, populations close to each other show more correlated dynamics than those at greater distances. However, several mechanisms can affect the extent of such spatial population synchrony, and we point to some similarities across systems that can explain the observed discrepancy between the spatial structure of the environment and that of population dynamics. We discuss the consequences of these findings for the practical management of species in a changing environment and the need for further research on how populations and ecosystems are affected by the spatial structure of the environment.

AB  - Hunting quotas are used to manage populations of game species in order to ensure sustainable exploitation. However, unpredictable climatic events may interact with hunting. We established a population model for European hares (Lepus europaeus) in Lower Austria. We compared the sustainability of voluntary quotas used by hunterswhich are derived from hare-specific guidelineswith the actual numbers of hares shot and our recommended quotas for hares, which have been derived from climate and population modeling. We used population modeling based on vital rates and densities to adjust our recommended quotas in order to achieve sustainable harvest. The survival of age classes 1 and 3 had the highest impact on the population growth rate. Population viability analysis showed that a recommended quota with a harvest rate of 10% was sustainable for population densities of 45 hares/km(2), and that the threshold for hunting should be raised from 10 hares/km(2) so that hare populations with <15 hares/km(2) are not hunted. The recommended quota outperformed the voluntary hunting quota, since more hares could be harvested sustainably. Age Class 1 survival was strongly linked with weather: a single year with unfavorable weather conditions (low precipitation) negatively affected population densities. Game species, including the European hare, face increasingly frequent weather extremes due to climate change, so hunting quotas need to be sensitive to frequent population fluctuations.

AB  - Understanding how reproductive tradeoffs act in concert with abiotic elements to affect survival is important for effective management and conservation of wildlife populations, particularly for at-risk or harvested species. Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) are a high-interest species for consumptive and non-consumptive uses, and female survival is a primary factor influencing turkey population dynamics. We radio-tracked and collected survival data on 140 female Merriam's wild turkeys (M. g. merriami) in the northern Black Hills, South Dakota, USA, 2016-2018. We developed and compared a set of candidate models to evaluate how nest incubation, brood rearing, and precipitation could be associated with female survival. Increased time spent incubating was associated with reduced female survival. Additionally, daily precipitation was associated with reduced survival of incubating females. Seasonal survival was lowest during spring and winter. A female that did not incubate a nest was predicted to have a higher rate of annual survival (0.53, 85% CI = 0.48-0.59) than a female that incubated a single nest (0.47, 85% CI = 0.42-0.53). Despite the relative proximity of population segments, we estimated that annual survival for nesting and non-nesting females was lower in the northern Black Hills compared to annual female survival in the southern Black Hills, underscoring the need for region-specific data when possible.

AB  - African houbara (Chlamydotis undulata) and Asian houbara (C. macqueenii), classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, have been over-exploited across their global ranges. The highest-profile conservation response has been large-scale releases of captive-bred birds, potentially threatening wild populations through introgression. Options for increasing numbers of the species are habitat management to counter overgrazing (in North Africa and the Middle East), mitigation of powerline collisions, predator control (ethically questionable and impractical), reduction of poaching and trapping, limited captive breeding, and hunting controls. Assuming hunting continues, the best model for conserving both species is a system of sustainable hunting that incorporates stakeholder observance, involvement of stakeholders and local communities in decisions and monitoring, protection of nohunting areas, scientifically-determined quotas, small-scale use of captive-bred birds, and-if numbers still fail to respond, as a last resort-moratoria. These measures provide the only realistic guarantee for the long-term survival of Arab falconry, a part of humanity's intangible cultural heritage.

AB  - The rapid rise of COVID-19 and the governmental response to slow the spread of the pandemic occurred prior to, or during, the opening of the spring wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) hunting seasons (Mar to May 2020) in the United States. The response of fish and wildlife agencies to the pandemic varied throughout the United States during the spring turkey season. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (NGPC) suspended the sale of non-resident, spring turkey hunting permits on 30 March 2020 in a proactive effort to minimize the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we evaluated the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the spring turkey permit sales and harvest in Nebraska, USA. We combined information from NGPC's electronic licensing system, responses from 2017-2019 spring turkey hunter surveys (pre-pandemic), and responses from the 2020 (during the pandemic) spring turkey hunter survey, which included additional questions about the influence of COVID-19 on respondents' hunting experiences. There was an increase in the number of resident hunters (23%) and resident permits sold (26%) and a decrease in the number of non-resident hunters (-88%) and non-resident permits sold (-89%) in 2020 as compared to the 3 years prior. Further, non-residents, more so than Nebraska residents, claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected their spring turkey hunting in their precautions taken, overall satisfaction, pre-season planning for the spring turkey season, and plans made prior to the outbreak. Wildlife agencies should prepare for the potential effects that significant disruptions (like that observed with the COVID-19 pandemic) might have on hunting participation, especially if a significant portion of revenue is derived from non-resident permit sales, and develop plans and policies so that they can react appropriately.

AB  - Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) use a polygynous mating system whereby males engage in multiple courtship behaviors, including vocalizations (gobbling) to attract females and compete with other males for breeding opportunities. Males must balance the risk of courtship behaviors with the reproductive potential of each courtship behavior. Male turkeys are primarily hunted during the reproductive period, so the associated risk of courtship behaviors is increased. Many state agencies attempt to set hunting season frameworks that maximize hunter satisfaction by allowing hunting when gobbling activity is greatest and most females are theoretically incubating nests, but the relationship between gobbling activity and nesting phenology is unclear. We used autonomous recording units and global positioning system transmitters to monitor gobbling activity by male turkeys and reproductive behaviors of female turkeys in the Piedmont region of Georgia, USA. We used 13,177 gobbles, behavioral data from 82 females during the reproductive season, and daily estimates of harvest of males by hunters to examine relationships between daily gobbling activity, cumulative removal of males, and reproductive behaviors (laying, incubating) of females during 2017-2018. We observed a weak negative relationship between daily gobbling activity and gobbling activity the following day. As the reproductive season progressed, gobbling activity decreased. As the proportion of females engaged in laying or incubating behaviors increased, expected daily gobbling activity increased. Conversely, we observed that hunting and removal of males had a negative effect on daily gobbling activity, and this effect was disproportionately greater than the positive effect of female reproductive behaviors. Our findings suggest that hunting and removal of males are important determinants of gobbling activity, and that corresponding reductions in gobbling activity may have mediating effects on the mating system of wild turkeys.

AB  - 1. The effects of predation are among the most pervasive in ecology. As parasitoids, parasites, grazers or top carnivores, predators have large influences on the distribution, density, dynamics and evolved traits of other organisms. Effects scale-up to influence community attributes such as species coexistence and ecosystems processes such as production or trophic cascades.        2. Increasingly, however, some of the largest predation issues fall clearly within the scope of applied ecology. They include instances where, due to their ecological attributes and trophic position: (i) predators are valuable to nature conservation, as biocontrol agents, as natural enemies, or as grazers used in rangeland or ecosystem management; (ii) natural or introduced predators are viewed negatively due to effects on conservation, agriculture, forestry, hunting or disease transmission; (iii) predators are affected by human activities such as, resource exploitation, or from exposure to factors such as biomagnified pollutants and disturbance; (iv) predators are controversial because different groups view them as either desirable or undesirable.        3. In all these cases, ecologists have a pivotal role in facilitating appropriate management. For valued predators, this involves developing sufficient ecological understanding to optimize habitat, increase prey abundance or to reinforce, establish or reintroduce desirable species. For predators considered undesirable, management can involve direct control. In other cases, predation and its consequences can be mitigated by deterrent, exclusion, supplementary feeding, habitat management to favour prey, predator swamping, or by compensating losses financially. These latter strategies are often used where predators are themselves considered too valuable to remove or control.        4. This collection of seven papers illustrates many of these themes by examining contrasting aspects of the applied ecology of Eurasian lynx; by further probing the interaction between predatory birds and red grouse; by exploring the effects of weather on biocontrol; and by illustrating effects on plant species where grazing or seed predation play a dominant role.        5. A key lesson from these and other recent papers in the Journal of Applied Ecology is that the successful management of predators depends invariably on understanding adequately the exact ecological context in which predator-prey interactions take place and in which problems arise. With predator-related issues growing rather than diminishing, ecologists will need sufficient resources to maintain current research if they are to provide the understanding required to offer and evaluate sound management.

AB  - Public forest management requires consideration of numerous objectives including protecting ecosystem health, sustaining habitats for native communities, providing sustainable forest products, and providing noncommodity ecosystem services. It is difficult to evaluate the long-term, cumulative effects and tradeoffs these and other associated management objectives. To demonstrate the capabilities of techniques suitable to support such evaluations we combined a spatially explicit landscape-scale, succession and disturbance model (LANDIS) with wildlife habitat suitability models and a multi-criteria decision-making framework to compare four management alternatives across a 700 km(2) area of the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri, USA. We estimated the combined, cumulative effects of tree species succession, fire disturbance, fuel accumulation, fire hazard, wind disturbance and timber harvest on future species composition, age class distribution, timber products, and wildlife habitat suitability for eastern wild turkey and eastern gray squirrel. We applied a structured, multi-criteria, decision-making framework (PROMETHEE) to analyse forest conditions and to derive weighted composite scores for seven criteria applied to each alternative management scenario. The approach provides a systematic, repeatable, transparent, spatially explicit framework for evaluating the long-term, landscape-scale cumulative effects of management alternatives. The methodology does not encompass all the factors that influence decisions about public land management, but it captures many important ones. The underlying models provide a way to test and accumulate knowledge about forest response to succession and disturbance and to use those relationships to support decision making with the best available science.

AB  - A critical assumption of radiotelemetry studies is that the radiotransmitters themselves do not influence mortality. Here we report the effects of marking techniques on survival of moose (Alces alces) calves from birth to the beginning of the autumn hunting season. We marked and followed 181 moose calves with ear tags and 71 with ear transmitters, and we also followed 175 unmarked control calves, all with marked mothers, in 5 study areas in Sweden; 2 areas had resident brown bears (Ursus arctos), and 3 did not. Survival was lower for calves with ear transmitters than for those with ear tags (P < 0.001) and for control calves (P < 0.001). There was no difference in survival between control calves and calves with ear tags (P = 0.09). Survival was lower in areas with bears, but bears apparently did not prey differentially on calves marked with ear transmitters. Marking newborn moose calves with plastic ear tags did not have measurable effects, but we do not recommend marking calves with ear transmitters, because of the high mortality rates calves experienced.

AB  - This study is the first to provide data on the extent of illegal hunting practices in Jordan using posts on social media. During January 2015-January 2016 photographs from seven hunter groups on Facebook recorded the killing of 4,707 native animals of 59 species, of which birds constituted the majority, followed by mammals and reptiles. Flouting of Jordanian laws was widespread, with daily bag limits exceeded on many occasions, and in the case of chukar partridge Alectoris chukar, the most popular quarry, some hunters exceeded the limit by 3,000%. Of even greater concern, a total of 34 species with special protection under Jordanian law were killed, and the hunting of large mammals, especially ibex Capra nubiana and gazelles (Gazella spp.), with already depleted populations, was particularly excessive. It also appeared that a significant number of gazelles were shot by unlicensed hunters from Arabian Gulf countries. Overall, the survey indicates an alarming picture of overhunting of threatened species and ineffective enforcement of hunting laws, despite the efforts of key government and voluntary agencies. We recommend urgent action to address the causes of the problem and to improve the management of hunting through better collaboration, mobilization of resources and awareness raising.

AB  - Gobbling activity of Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris; hereafter, turkeys) has been widely studied, focusing on drivers of daily variation. Weather variables are widely believed to influence gobbling activity, but results across studies are contradictory and often equivocal, leading to uncertainty in the relative contribution of weather variables to daily fluctuations in gobbling activity. Previous works relied on road-based auditory surveys to collect gobbling data, which limits data consistency, duration, and quantity due to logistical difficulties associated with human observers and restricted sampling frames. Development of new methods using autonomous recording units (ARUs) allows researchers to collect continuous data in more locations for longer periods of time, providing the opportunity to delve into factors influencing daily gobbling activity. We used ARUs from 1 March to 31 May to detail gobbling activity across multiple study sites in the southeastern United States during 2014-2018. We used state-space modeling to investigate the effects of weather variables on daily gobbling activity. Our findings suggest rainfall, greater wind speeds, and greater temperatures negatively affected gobbling activity, whereas increasing barometric pressure positively affected gobbling activity. Therefore, when using daily gobbling activity to make inferences relative to gobbling chronology, reproductive phenology, and hunting season frameworks, stakeholders should recognize and consider the potential influences of extended periods of inclement weather.

AB  - In Andalusia, southern Spain, each game estate applies its own rules and presents its results in annual hunting reports, which have been mandatory for Spanish game estates since 1989. We used the information about hunting yields, included in 32134 annual hunting reports produced during the period 1993/94 to 2001/02 by 6049 game estates, to determine the current distribution of hunting yields of big and small game species in Andalusia. Using generalised linear models and a geographic information system, we determined the most favourable municipalities to big and small game, respectively, and delimited potential areas to attain good hunting yields for big and small game at a 1-km(2) resolution. Municipalities and areas favourable to big game are mainly located in the Sierra Morena and the westernmost fringe of the Betic Range, while those favourable to small game occupy the upper Guadalquivir River valley. There is a clear segregation between big and small game species according to the physiography and land uses of the territory. Big game species are typical of Mediterranean woodland areas, while the most emblematic small game species prefer agricultural areas. Our results provide a territorial ordination of hunting yields in southern Spain and have several potential applications in strategic planning for hunting activities and biodiversity conservation in Andalusia that can be extrapolated to other regions.

AB  - Pinus rigida (Pitch Pine)-Quercus ilicifolia (Scrub Oak) barrens require active management to maintain, but the effects of forest management on snakes and game birds is poorly understood. We conducted vegetation surveys and examined incidental encounter data of a variety of snake and game bird species on a managed pine barren in Montague, MA, from 2008 to 2018. We recorded 73 observations, including 44 Coluber constrictor constrictor (Northern Black Racer) and 7 Aleleagris gallopavo (Wild Turkey) nests. All of our observations were in managed habitats (Scrub Oak, treated Pitch Pine, and powerline corridors) which had low (<30%) tree canopy cover. Observed densities of Northern Black Racers did not significantly vary among these open-canopy habitats, or with time since treatment between 2 to 8 years since initial harvest in treated Pitch Pine. We did not conduct extensive surveys in unmanaged, closed-canopy Pitch Pine forests; thus, we were unable to determine the relative use by racers and game birds of unmanaged versus managed habitats. Nevertheless, snakes and game birds were using and nesting in the managed habitats at least to some extent. Our findings on racers and game birds from this study are preliminary, but combined with results from other studies, they suggest that ecosystem management in pine barrens can benefit snakes and game birds, along with a wide variety of other taxa.

AB  - Red fox Vulpes vulpes predation on roe deer Capreolus capreolus fawns is regarded as a very important factor affecting recruitment of roe deer. Therefore from a hunting management perspective, it is of interest to find efficient ways to reduce predation. Because predator removal during Summer is highly controversial and banned by law in Scandinavia, supplemental feeding of red foxes during the short, critical fawning period of roe deer has been proposed as a means to relieve predation on fawns. We performed a two-year study of providing red fox vixens with food, supplied as close to active dens as possible, and monitored recruitment of radio-marked roe deer in the vicinity of these dens at a realistic management scale (i.e. the size of a large hunting area; similar to 65 km(2)). Even though red foxes found and consumed the food Supplied, we found no tendency towards increased recruitment of roe deer. We conclude that supplemental feeding of red foxes during the fawning period is not a Solution to this management problem, at least not at the chosen management scale and with the current red fox predation levels.

AB  - Earlier reports from Fennoscandia and Russia have shown that among adult capercaillies the proportion of females is 60-65%, mainly as a consequence of high mortality of male chicks during their first months of life. The Finnish August censuses of grouse (1964-1988) show that the percentage of female capercaillie has remained unchanged at about 60-65% in northern and eastern Finland. Over the same period the percentage of females in southern and central Finland has decreased significantly from 62 to 50%. The present geographical variation in the percentage of females seems to coincide with the amount of forest in the landscape; the proportion of females is lowest in the southern and western part of Finland where the proportion of agricultural land is highest. Data from 1989-1996 show that variation in August male density among game management districts in Finland (CV%: 21.9) is significantly smaller than that of females (CV%: 33.4). This suggests that the variation in female proportion is more dependent on variation in female than in male density. The most probable reasons for the change in sex ratio include predation on females by mammalian and avian predators and selective hunting (or closing of hunting seasons), but tests of these hypotheses are premature at present.

AB  - Why are organised shoots involving birds that are farm-reared and subsequently released a dividing issue in several countries? As a contribution to answering this question the paper reports a national survey of landowners (n=1207), hunters (n=1130) and the general public (n = 1001) in Denmark. While there was broad agreement across all three groups that recreational hunting of naturally occurring "surplus" wildlife is acceptable, the release of farm-reared game birds for shooting was a dividing issue, both within the groups and between them. The majority of participants (51%) in the survey representing the general public were against the practice; a majority of hunters (61%) were in favour of it; and landowner approval rates lay between these two poles. Respondents with a "mutualist" or "distanced" wildlife value orientation according to the definitions by Teel et al. (2005) consistently displayed a more negative attitude to rear and release shooting than those with a "utilitarian" orientation. The differences in attitude could not be explained in terms solely of underlying concerns about nature conservation and biodiversity protection. Concerns about the behaviour of the released birds, and about hunting "culture" and regulatory measures, also informed the participants' attitudes. The regulatory framework governing shooting based on the release of farm-reared birds could reflect a wider range of concerns than those hitherto acknowledged. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Brownie tag-recovery model is useful for estimating harvest rates but assumes all tagged individuals survive to the first hunting season; otherwise, mortality between time of tagging and the hunting season will cause the Brownie estimator to be negatively biased. Alternatively, fitting animals with radio transmitters can be used to accurately estimate harvest rate but may be more costly. We developed a joint model to estimate harvest and annual survival rates that combines known-fate data from animals fitted with transmitters to estimate the probability of surviving the period from capture to the first hunting season, and data from reward-tagged animals in a Brownie tag-recovery model. We evaluated bias and precision of the joint estimator, and how to optimally allocate effort between animals fitted with radio transmitters and inexpensive ear tags or leg bands. Tagging-to-harvest survival rates from >20 individuals with radio transmitters combined with 50-100 reward tags resulted in an unbiased and precise estimator of harvest rates. In addition, the joint model can test whether transmitters affect an individual's probability of being harvested. We illustrate application of the model using data from wild turkey, Meleagris gallapavo, to estimate harvest rates, and data from white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, to evaluate whether the presence of a visible radio transmitter is related to the probability of a deer being harvested. The joint known-fate tag-recovery model eliminates the requirement to capture and mark animals immediately prior to the hunting season to obtain accurate and precise estimates of harvest rate. In addition, the joint model can assess whether marking animals with radio transmitters affects the individual's probability of being harvested, caused by hunter selectivity or changes in a marked animal's behavior.

AB  - Information about game population states and hunting regulation are important prerequisites in ensuring the sustainability of populations. Voluntary game monitoring has a potential of being an important factor in addition to the monitoring made by professionals. The main method in the monitoring of many game species in Finland is the wildlife triangle scheme (WTS), providing abundance estimates of about 30 species. The WTS is largely carried out by voluntarily participating hunting teams. Regardless of the long traditions in the hunters' monitoring activity and hunting regulation, very little is known about the characteristics of the hunting teams that have been active in the WTS. To gain more insight into the characteristics of the hunting teams at a national and regional scale, we analysed quantitative questionnaire data on various activities of hunting teams collected by the Hunters' Central Organization. A typical team carrying out censuses has a large number of members and large hunting grounds, and its monitoring activity is also associated with the voluntary regulation of the hunting of grouse as well as other management actions. The findings indicate that especially large hunting teams are active in voluntary game monitoring in Finland, but also small groups of motivated individuals can successfully participate in the WTS.

AB  - Effective management and modelling of the Playa Lakes Region (PLR) mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population requires season and cause specific survival estimates. Habitat protection and management strategies will benefit from survival data as well. Thus, we monitored 153 radio-marked female mallards during 3 winters 1986-87 to 1988-89, to examine factors affecting survival in the PLR. Mean survival rate during the 100-day period 21 November to 1 March was 0.777 +/- 0.04 (SE). We did not detect any age or annual differences in survival. Precipitation and habitat availability varied among years. Survival rates (S) were higher (P < 0.10) for individuals in good body condition (s = 0.888 +/- 0.07) than those in poor condition (S = 0.661 +/- 0.09). The hunting season mortality rate was 0.018 +/- 0.05. Natural mortality, which included avian predation, during the 100-day study period was 0.210 (+/- 0.07). Crippling mortality could not be determined because of rapid carcass loss. Early season body condition and extended sub-freezing weather appear to impact mallard survival most in the PLR. Habitat management should encompass the entire PLR to include secondary habitats used by mallards during freezing weather.

AB  - The article presents the results of the identification of 1051 bird remains from the ancient layers of the 12 settlements from the Northern Black Sea coast. Zooarchaeological finds described in the work date to the sixth century BC through the fourth century AD. The data allowed researchers to specify features of bird exploitation by the inhabitants of the region. In particular, we established that, hunted birds dominated over domestic species in the diet of inhabitants of large settlements. However, previous publications on the results of mammalian studies suggested that hunting did not play a significant role, but was rather an entertainment. We also found that the inhabitants of small settlements consumed more poultry than wild species of birds. The earlier reports about the discovery of pheasant's remains in the ancient layers of the Northern Black Sea Coast were refuted. The report presents the bone of the chicken with osteopetrosis, which appears as the most eastern evidence of the disease in the archaeological records in Europe. Some changes were discovered in the avifauna. The primary changes took place during the Hellenistic time (350-200 BC), when the region experienced a reduction in species diversity. We assume that the changes in fauna are a consequence of the climatic shifts which took place in the Roman Warm Period.

AB  - To evaluate the potential contribution of captive breeding to the conservation of exploited migratory Asian houbara Chlamydotis macqueenii, we estimated release numbers required to stabilise a population in a hunting concession (14,300 km(2)), under scenarios of local licensed hunting and flyway-scale protection. We developed a population model, initially 2350 adult females, re-sampling parameters measured through fieldwork and satellite telemetry, over 1000 iterations. With current flyway-scale unregulated harvest, and without any licensed hunting in the concession, populations declined at 9.4% year(-1) (95% CI: -18.9 to 0% year(-1)); in this scenario a precautionary approach (85% probability lambda >= 1.0) to population stabilisation required releasing 3100 captive bred females year(-1) (131% of initial wild numbers). A precautionary approach to sustainable hunting of 100 females year(-1) required releasing 3600 females year(-1) (153% of initial wild numbers); but if interventions reduced flyway-scale hunting/trapping mortality by 60% or 80%, sustaining this quota required releasing 900 or 400 females year(-1), 38% and 17% of initial wild numbers, respectively. Parameter uncertainty increased precautionary numbers for release, but even with reduced precaution (50% probability lambda >= 1.0), sustainable hunting of 100 females year(-1) required annual releases of 2200 females (94% wild) without other measures, but 300 (13%) or no (0%) females under scenarios of a 60% or 80% reduction in flyway-scale hunting/trapping. Captive breeding cannot alone sustain migrant populations of wild C. macqueenii because it risks replacement and domestication. Trade and exploitation must be restricted to avoid either extinction or domestication. For exploited populations, supplementation by captive breeding should be used with caution.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the content of Cu, Zn, Ph and Cd in livers and breast muscles of mallards obtained in Warmia and Mazury in 1999-2000. Samples from 32 mallards hunted in Lezany, Zembrze, Szestno and Nidzica, as well as samples from 7 pheasants and 6 mallards from the area of Slask were analyzed. Concentration of all the four metals was higher in the liver than in breast muscles. Mean contents of copper in livers of juvenile and adult mallards from Warmia and Mazury were similar (6.567 and 8.632 mg/kg w.w.). Levels of zinc were approximately the same in both age groups (23.911 mg/kg w.w. in young birds and 25.418 mg/kg w.w. in adults). As regards lead, older mallards from Warmia and Mazury had twice as much of the metal in the liver (0.417 mg/kg w.w.). The content of Pb in the liver was similar in both age groups of the birds from Slask. The differences in the concentration of cadmium in the mallards from Warmia and Mazury were smaller. Cd in the amount of 0.128 mg/kg m.m. was found in the young mallards and 0.171 mg/kg m.m. in the adult mallards. The birds from the area of Slask contained much higher concentrations of Cd in their tissues, over I mg/kg m.m. in the liver and over 0.200 mg/kg m.m. in the breast muscles.

AB  - The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the northern Rocky Mountains provides the context for a natural experiment to investigate the response of consumers to resources with differing spatial and temporal dispersion regimes. Grey wolves (Canis lupus) and human hunters both provide resource subsidies to scavengers by provisioning them with the remains of their kills. Carrion from hunter kills is highly aggregated in time and space whereas carrion from wolf kills is more dispersed in both time and space. We estimated the total amount of carrion consumed by each scavenger species at both wolf and hunter kills over 4 years. Species with large feeding radii [bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and ravens (Corpus corax)], defined as the area over which a consumer can efficiently locate and integrate resources, dominated consumption at the highly aggregated hunter kills whereas competitively dominant species [coyotes (Canis latrans)] dominated at the more dispersed wolf kills. In addition, species diversity and the evenness of carrion consumption between scavengers was greater at wolf kills than at hunter kills while the total number of scavengers at hunter kills exceeded those at wolf kills. From a community perspective, the top-down effect of predation is likely to be stronger in the vicinity of highly aggregated resource pulses as species with large feeding radii switch to feeding on alternative prey once the resource pulse subsides.

AB  - The 'Landscapes of Settlement Project' has carried out archaeological and paleoenvironmental research in the Lake Myvatn region of N. Iceland since 1996. Animal bone collections dating from the late 9th century to the early 13th century AD have been recovered from five sites in different ecological zones around the lake, and three of these sites provide multiple phases datable through radiocarbon, artefacts, and volcanic tephra. Modern systematic biological and geological investigations in the Myvatn district date to the 19th century and a detailed picture of the recent ecology can be combined with both archaeological and historical evidence for long term resource exploitation by humans in this inland region. Analysis of bird bones and bird eggshell suggests that the locally managed sustainable harvest of migratory waterfowl eggs carried out over the last 150 years extends back to the 9th century. These inland archaeofauna also include significant numbers of marine fish and sea birds, marine mollusca, and a few seal and porpoise bones. Marine fish remains recovered indicate specialised transport of partial skeletons missing most cranial and some thoracic vertebrae, suggesting that a cured fish product was being regularly brought to inland farms during the early years of the settlement. Inter-regional exchange and a pre-Hanseatic artisanal fish trade prior to AD 1000 suggests the importance of preserved marine fish in early Scandinavian economies, and may shed light on the source of the 11th century 'fish event horizon' recently documented in southern Britain.

AB  - The illegal hunting of wild birds is still today a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity on a global scale. This activity jeopardizes the survival of several migratory species. Our aims in this work were to (1) determine the spatial and temporal distribution of illegal hunting activities affecting bird species with regard to the location of fixed hunting posts in particular, and (2) identify the most affected species in Gipuzkoa (north of Spain), situated in a bottleneck area within one of the main routes of migration between Europe and Africa. All of our data came from birds with firearm injuries that were admitted to the Gipuzkoa Wildlife Rehabilitation Center (WRC). Over a period of 8 years (2006-2013), 421 birds belonging to 53 species were registered. The number of shot birds was found to be greater in more highly populated areas and during the months coinciding with hunting periods. Moreover, shot birds were recovered close to fixed hunting posts, suggesting that the illegal shooting of birds took place near or directly from these posts. Although the figures were not comparable to the high numbers of migrants shot annually in some other southern European areas, our results show that, even in small areas like Gipuzkoa, increased levels of protection are necessary.

AB  - Hunting is an activity that appears to provoke - often immediate and strongly pronounced - moral assessments, i.e., judgments of what is 'right' or 'wrong'. A large body of literature explores these moral arguments, often from a philosophical or normative perspective, focusing on specific types of hunting. However, studies that ground such explorations in empirical, systematically analysed, yet contextualised data seem to be missing. We argue that such an approach is essential to understand conflicts over hunting and wildlife management, and present data from focus group discussions and interviews with hunters, non-hunters and hunting critics across six countries in Europe and eastern Africa.        Our findings suggest that moral arguments play an extremely important role in the legitimation and delegitimation of hunting practices through discourse. In particular, study participants referred to the motives of hunters as a factor that, in their eyes, determined the acceptability of hunting practices. Moral argumentations exhibited patterns that were common across study sites, such as a perceived moral superiority of the 'moderate' and 'measured', and a lack of legitimacy of the 'excessive'. Implicit orders of hunting motives were used to legitimise types of hunting that were suspected to be contested.        On the basis of these findings, we discuss how the moral elements of hunting discourses relate to broader discourses on environmental management, and how these are used to establish (or dispute) the legitimacy of hunting. Our analysis also suggests that there might be more overlap between moral arguments of hunters, non-hunters and hunting critics than popularly assumed, which, where required, could be used as a starting point for conflict management.

AB  - The Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust's National Gamebag Census (NGC) has been collecting voluntary bag returns from shoots across the UK since 1961. Methods similar to the ones used for bird census data are applied to NGC data to derive annual bag indices for the UK, assess temporal trends and evaluate changes in bags over 50, 25 and 12 years for 30 bird species and 15 mammal species, as well as for numbers released of four bird species. Total UK bags and numbers released in the 2004 and 2012 seasons are obtained by splitting up aggregate bags from two independent surveys (PACEC 2006, 2014) in relation to their NGC species composition. These are used to calibrate NGC species-specific bag indices and obtain estimates of total UK bags and numbers released for the 2016 season. Over 50years, large changes have taken place in the bags and numbers released of some species whereas bags of others have remained approximately constant. This work contributes to pan-European efforts seeking a rational assessment of hunting effects within a policy combining conservation and the sustainable use of wildlife, in line with national and international legislation.

AB  - Numerical responses of martens (Martes americana) to a synchronous decline of most prey species were studied from 1980 to 1985. Main prey species included snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), southern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and ruffed grous (Bonasa umbellus). Populations of these prey species were high in 1980-81 and substantially reduced from 1982 to 1985 except ruffed grouse, which were  abundant in 1984-85. Responses of martens included reduced population density, enlarged home ranges, lower ovulation rates in females aged 1 and 2 years, reduced production of young, dispersal of formerly resident adults during the 2nd year of scarce food, and cannibalism. Dispersal of residents resulted in an unexpectedly high trapping success in 1983, suggesting that fur returns do not reflect changing population levels for marten. Male body weights did not differ among years but females  weighed more in early winter of scarce food years compared to the same period when food was abundant (P .ltoreq. 0.01). Less mesenteric and renal fat was found on all martens during the 1st winter of scarce food (P .ltoreq. 0.001). We believe that a reservoir strategy for marten management can be an effective tool, but when food is low managers must account for larger home ranges and possible dispersal of residents by reducing harvest quotas.

AB  - Hunting bag statistics are often the only available data for performing ecological studies about harvested species, and total harvest is sometimes used as a proxy of abundance of the game species under study in a given geo-graphical area and period of time. This practice raises at least two questions, (i) are the total hunting bag estimates good indices of population abundance, and if so, for what uses?, (ii) what is the reliability of given hunting bag statistics and is it possible to evaluate and take into account their uncertainty without relying on uncheckable assumptions? This methodological paper is aimed at answering the second question, from the point of view of the hunters' sampling. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we illustrate the potential selection bias induced by relying on volunteer samples of hunters. We expose the statistical causes and remedies to this issue. We put the emphasis on the paramount importance of random sampling, both for avoiding selection bias and to perform statistical inferences on a sound basis, in a framework free of statistical assumptions. We explain under what circumstances not taking into account unequal inclusion probabilities at the estimation stage could result in biased estimation. The acknowledgement that for a selection bias to occur, it is necessary that both the unequal inclusion probabilities are not accounted for in the estimators and these probabilities are correlated to the individual hunting bags is a statistical result that is neither widely known nor appreciated by most wildlife ecologists - and perhaps also, some wildlife statisticians.

AB  - Hunting is a widespread but often overlooked land-use activity, providing major benefits to society. Hunting takes placein most landscapes, yet it remains unclear which types of landscapes foster or dampen hunting-related services, and how hunting relatesto other land uses. A better understanding of these relationships is key for sustainable land-use planning that integrates wildlifemanagement. This is particularly urgent for Europe, where wildlife populations are increasing. Focusing on Sweden, we explored thespatial associations among hunting, agriculture, and forestry to identify archetypical combinations of these land uses. Specifically, wecombined indicators on the extent and intensity of agriculture and forestry, with data on hunting bags for 63 game species using self-organizing maps, a non-parametric clustering approach. We identified 15 typical bundles of co-occurring land uses at the municipalitylevel across Sweden. The harvest of forest grouse, bears, and moose co-occurred with forestry in northern Sweden, whereas the harvestof small game, different deer species, and wild boar co-occurred with agriculture across southern Sweden, reflecting species' biology,environmental factors, and management. Our findings also highlight the strength of associations among hunting and other land uses.Importantly, we identified large areas in central Sweden where harvest of game was below average, possibly indicating that intensityof hunting is out of balance with that of agriculture or forestry, potentially fostering conflict between wildlife and land use. Collectively,our results suggest that (1) hunting should be considered a major land use that, in Sweden, is more widespread than agriculture andforestry; (2) land-use planning must therefore integrate wildlife management; and (3) such an integration should occur in a regionalizedmanner that considers social-ecological context. Our approach identifies a first spatial template within which such context-specificland-use planning, aiming at aligning wildlife and diverse land uses, can take places.

AB  - The increases in ungulate populations and hunting bags throughout Europe and North America have resulted in higher carcass numbers available for mesocarnivore species in temperate and boreal forests. The increase in food resources can sustain denser predator populations, potentially affecting prey species such as the threatened western capercaillie Tetrao urogallus. We investigated the ungulate population trends in recent decades and the carrion use by facultative scavengers in areas of the Pyrenees occupied by capercaillie to assess the potential effects on predation of nests and adult birds, and on its population trend. We found a significant increase in the number of ungulates harvested during the period of sharp capercaillie population decline. Carrion was provided experimentally in forested areas occupied by capercaillie showing that remains were mainly consumed by red fox Vulpes vulpes, followed by wild boar Sus scrofa and marten species (Martes sp.). Season (cold or warm) was the most important factor determining scavenging activity in most species. Main predators of capercaillie nests and adults were martens and red fox, with no predation by wild boar. Our data show that main predators of capercaillie are the same species that mainly consume carrion, especially in winter, and that plentiful carrion resources could maintain higher populations of these species, potentially increasing predation pressure on the capercaillie population. This study shows that managing carrion arising from hunting activity in areas of capercaillie distribution is a necessary management action to reduce the available carrion biomass and so reduce the impact of mesocarnivores on capercaillie conservation.

AB  - Although biodiversity-related conflicts are generally embedded into an ecological, economic and social context, reported studies often focus on only one of these aspects. The practical facilitation of such conflicts typically adopts an equally restricted view. The developing field of biodiversity conflict management is thus fragmented and, due to its generally insular case study approach, lacks theoretical underpinning. We propose a conceptual framework that, while it takes a social scientific viewpoint to reflect the inherently social nature of conflict between humans over natural resources, integrates social, economic and ecological factors to improve the understanding and management of biodiversity-related conflicts. The framework distinguishes between (i) factors that characterise the conflict and shape its dynamics and (ii) indicators that may be used to assess the potential for and severity of a conflict and its development over time. Factors serve to identify the main drivers of a conflict and enable comparison of conflicts over the same issue across sites and communities, as the relative impact of particular factors is likely to vary between cases. indicators, in turn, result from the interplay between factors. They are characterised by different degrees of overtness and include attitudinal, behavioural and outcome-related indices. We show how this framework can serve to analyse conflicts, and how it could be developed further as a basis for modelling approaches. Principles of the framework are illustrated through its application to a specific biodiversity conflict in the Scottish uplands. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The management of wildlife hosts for controlling parasites and disease has a history of mixed success. Deer can be important hosts for ticks, such as Ixodes ricinus, which is the primary vector of disease-causing zoonotic pathogens in Europe. Deer are generally managed by culling and fencing for forestry protection, habitat conservation, and commercial hunting, and in this study we test whether these deer management methods can be useful for controlling ticks, with implications for tick-borne pathogens. At different spatial scales and habitats we tested the hypotheses that tick abundance is reduced by (1) culling deer and (2) deer exclusion using fencing. We compared abundance indices of hosts and questing I. ricinus nymphs using a combination of small-scale fencing experiments on moorland, a large-scale natural experiment of fenced and unfenced pairs of forests, and cross-sectional surveys of forest and moorland areas with varying deer densities. As predicted, areas with fewer deer had fewer ticks, and fenced exclosures had dramatically fewer ticks in both large-scale forest and small-scale moorland plots. Fencing and reducing deer density were also associated with higher ground vegetation. The implications of these results on other hosts, pathogen prevalence, and disease risk are discussed. This study provides evidence of how traditional management methods of a keystone species can reduce a generalist parasite, with implications for disease risk mitigation.

AB  - As the second largest cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, there is an urgent need to study the dynamics of biological invasions and identify factors limiting the distribution of invasive alien species. In the present study we analyze national-scale hunting bag data from Germany to predict the dispersal of raccoons in the largest non-native population of the species. Our focus is (1) to document changes in the distribution and abundance of raccoons, (2) to identify the species-environment relationship and predict which areas will be suitable for future colonization and (3) to apply a dispersal model to predict how fast the raccoon will spread to these areas. The increase from about 9000 harvested raccoons in 2000/01 to about 71,000 in 2011/12 reflects the extensive amount of suitable habitat for this omnivorous species in Central Europe. The best model for explaining range expansion in Germany identified coverage of agriculture and fragmentation and coverage of forests as the most important explanatory variables. The range of raccoons ( area with harvest index >0.1 per 100 ha) increased from 26,515 km(2) in 2001 to 111,630 km(2) in 2011, and is predicted to expand to 252,940 km(2) by 2061, 71 % of the area of Germany. This vast area encompasses strategically important areas for conservation biology, such as wetlands with endangered native terrapins. The combination of merging of separated introduced populations and accelerating population growth highlights the potential for future impacts of raccoons on native communities, ecosystems and economic life in Germany and Central Europe.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) in surface waters is a micronutrient, but elevated concentrations are toxic to fish and impair drinking water quality. In Scotland, undesirable Mn concentrations (> 0.05 mg l(-1)) occur predominantly in upland freshwaters because the acidic pH and organic nature of catchment soils favour Mn mobilisation. The relationship between upland land-use in Scotland and Mn concentrations in surface waters is reviewed. Conifer afforestation is associated with enhanced Mn in runoff. Mn is leached from conifer foliage and litter, and mature conifers enhance acid deposition and loss of Mn from acidified catchment soils. After harvesting, increased soil pools of water-soluble Mn and elevated Mn concentrations in runoff have been observed. Liming, fertiliser addition, drainage ditch construction and ploughing to improve upland pastures, and muirburn on grouse moors may also increase Mn concentrations in runoff, but the evidence is less clear-cut. The extent to which land-use influences Mn concentrations in upland catchments in Scotland is modified by catchment hydrology and soil type. Catchment geology, instream processes and standing water stratification are probably lesser influences on Mn concentrations in surface waters of upland catchments in Scotland. The location of land-use in upland catchments, especially in the riparian zone. is critical in determining its effect on Mn in runoff. Climate change is expected to increase Mn concentrations in runoff from upland catchments in Scotland because of predicted changes in soil hydrology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Synchrony in bag records over large spatio-temporal scales point to factors acting simultaneously on population size. In this manuscript, we analysed time series of annual roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) bag records for 17 European countries for the time span 1961-2013. Even though a synchronous increase in bag records was identified in 14 of 17 countries between 1986 and 1992, bag records were not synchronised at the European level. We detected a significant positive correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index (December-March) and annual changes in roe deer bag records for Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden. Further time-series analyses revealed a significant lag length (L) in 13 of 17 time series on roe deer bag records which highlights that the number of bagged deer in year t was significantly correlated to the number of bagged deer in year t + L (negative association). We conclude that large-scale environmental variations or human-induced changes will not only induce periodic fluctuations in wildlife populations but also in wildlife harvest. By incorporating the knowledge about population dynamics of large herbivores into management concepts, wildlife management will not only decrease the chances of serious pitfalls but also optimise measures for population control and conservation.

AB  - We examine the abundance and distribution of Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and nine prey species in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on Sumatra, Indonesia. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the relative abundance of tigers and their prey, as measured by camera traps, is directly related to independently derived estimates of densities for these species. The tiger population in the park is estimated at 40-43 individuals. Results indicate that illegal hunting of prey and tigers, measured as a function of human density within 10 kin of the park, is primarily responsible for observed patterns of abundance, and that habitat loss is an increasingly serious problem. Abundance of tigers, two mouse deer (Tragulus spp.), pigs (Sus scrofa) and Sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) was more than four times higher in areas with low human population density, while densities of red muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac) and pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were twice as high. Malay tapir (Tapirus indicus) and argus pheasant (Argusianus argus), species infrequently hunted, had higher indices of relative abundance in areas with high human density. Edge effects associated with park boundaries were not a significant factor in abundance of tigers or prey once human density was considered. Tigers in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, and probably other protected areas throughout Sumatra, are in imminent danger of extinction unless trends in hunting and deforestation are reversed.

AB  - The sustainable use of natural resources such as game animals requires adjusting extraction to changes in population abundance. Population abundance monitoring is thus necessary to ensure an adaptive management, but this can be difficult in the case of migratory species where breeding areas are in remote places without local monitoring programs. Predictive models of the winter abundance based in the relation between climate and reproduction success or survival could be a useful alternative to monitoring networks in the breeding areas. In this paper, we evaluate the role of weather variables as indicators of winter abundance estimates. We used Game Abundance Indices (total number of woodcock observed during hunting days, divided by the number of hunting hours), collected by volunteer hunters during 21 seasons, and temperature, rainfall and number of days with snow, calculated in May, June and July in the breeding areas and December to January in the winter areas. The best models explaining variations in winter abundance included number of rainy days in May and June and temperature in July as explanatory variables. All variables were positively correlated with abundance except temperature in July. The predictive quality of the best model based on a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (i.e. the Pearson correlation coefficient between observed values and LOO-predicted values) was 0.76. We discuss the applications of this predictive model to develop an adaptive hunting management scheme for the species.

AB  - This study reports the results obtained from toxicological analyses of different types of baits referred to the laboratory of the Toxicology Area (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Caceres, Spain) over a 17-year period (2002-2018). These baits were suspicious materials found in the environment of the region of Extremadura (Western Spain), where such malpractices are a problem to be addressed, as wide livestock farming and hunting activities are combined with a significant wealth of wildlife (especially birds of prey). A total of 246 baits, including 32 commercial chemical products to be used in baits, were analysed. Samples from 183 cases were received and classified according to the material used for their preparation and the toxic substance found. Overall, the most common bait consisted of meat preparations (56.3% of cases) intended to eliminate predators considered 'annoying' for livestock and hunting practices, such as carnivores and scavengers. It should be noted that contact baits (as fenthion-impregnated perches) were also detected (7.6%). Regarding the substances detected, anticholinesterase compounds (organophosphates and carbamates) were the most commonly used substances for the preparation of baits (detected in 85.3% of positive baits). Moreover, 8% of the positive baits presented more than one toxic substance in their composition. Due to the types of toxic compounds and the methods used to prepare the baits, this study shows that the malicious use of highly toxic substances in the environment to kill wildlife is a common and current issue and poses a serious risk to different species.

AB  - Knowledge of reproductive parameters and assessment of the relative importance of factors affecting reproductive success are essential for effective management of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris). We determined reproductive parameters of 599 radiomarked hens (293 for >1 yr), and the effects of age. year, region, condition (winter weight), incubation chronology (periods), land-ownership, and weather on their reproductive success in 3 Appalachian Mountain regions of Virginia and West Virginia. Average first nest incubation initiation was May 5 +/- 0.6 days ((x) over bar +/- SE, n = 629). Production rate (poults alive 4 weeks post hatch/female alive 1 Apr) averaged 1.46 +/- 0.09 (n = 863). Nesting rates were lower than studies in other regions and may be limiting reproduction. Production rates increased with age (juv: 0.4 +/- 0.14, 2+: 1.40 +/- 0.14, 3+: 2.55 +/- 0.25), but did not differ among regions, years, or weight classes of winter-trapped juvenile or adult hens. Reproduction was evaluated by quintiles (periods) of the first incubation dates by year. Hens that began incubation in the second or third periods had higher (>67%) incubation completion rates than other periods (less than or equal to 50%), but potential production rates (poults alive 4 weeks post hatch/female completing incubation) were not different among incubation periods. Potential production rates were higher on private lands (3.93 +/- 0.30) than public lands (2.67 +/- 0.43). Nest incubation dates in Virginia were correlated with mean March temperatures (p = -0.53) and snow depth (p = 0.52). Managers should cautiously implement or increase fall either-sex hunting seasons in populations with survival and production rates similar to those we studied. Older hens play a critical role in reproductive success in the Appalachians. In areas with fall either-sex hunting, season timing and length that reduce adult vulnerability may lessen hunting impacts on reproduction and population growth.

AB  - Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) use a polygynous-promiscuous mating system, wherein males compete for mating opportunities and communicate with females via courtship behaviors. One courtship behavior is vocalization (gobbling), which attracts females and signals dominance to other males. However, temporal variation in gobbling activity may be influenced by external stimuli, environmental variation, and hunter activity. Gobbling activity is a key determinant of hunter satisfaction, and gobbling chronology is often used by state agencies to inform regulatory processes. To identify factors influencing gobbling activity, we evaluated daily gobbling chronology on 3 sites in South Carolina, USA (Webb Wildlife Management Area [WMA] Complex, Savannah River Site, Crackerneck WMA) with different levels of hunter activity. We used autonomous recording units (ARUs; n = 45) across 8,280 days to collect 53,937 hours of ambient sound recordings and identified 68,426 gobbles. Gobbling activity varied daily and site interacting with minutes since sunrise best predicted daily gobbling activity. We noted distinct differences in predicted numbers of gobbles between hunted sites and an unhunted site, suggesting that hunting may be an important determinant of gobbling activity. Across our study sites, we observed that >= 72% of gobbling activity occurred between 30 minutes before and 60 minutes after sunrise. We found no clear evidence of well-defined unimodal or bimodal peaks in daily or weekly gobbling activity. Across sites, <44% of gobbling activity occurred during legal hunting seasons in South Carolina, with between 30% and 48% of gobbling activity occurring after legal hunting seasons. Because hunter satisfaction is primarily influenced by gobbling activity, wildlife managers in South Carolina may consider adjusting dates of turkey hunting seasons to correspond hunting with periods when most gobbling occurs.

AB  - Frequent prescribed fire (3 yr) and selective harvest of off-site hardwoods are the primary restoration and management tools for pine (Pinus spp.) savannas in the southeastern United States. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) habitat selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct our future management decisions. Therefore, we investigated habitat selection of female turkeys in 2 longleaf pine savanna systems managed by frequent fire in southwestern Georgia during 2011-2013. We observed differential habitat selection across 2 scales (study area and seasonal area of use) and 3 seasons (fall-winter: 1 Oct-30 Jan; pre-breeding: 1 Feb-19 Apr; and summer: 16 Jun-30 Sep). During fall-winter, turkeys selected mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, and young pine stands, albeit at different scales. During pre-breeding, turkeys selected for mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, young pine, and shrub-scrub, although at different scales. During summer, turkeys also demonstrated scale-specific selection but generally selected for mature pine, hardwoods, and shrub-scrub. Days-since-fire did not influence selection of stands managed by frequent fire (3 yr). In cases where female turkeys used pine-dominated stands (i.e., mature pine, young pine, and mixed pine-hardwoods), selection was not influenced by days-since-fire; however, these results are at least partially due to a lack of longer burn rotations (>3 yr) on our study areas. We suggest land managers consider scale of selection by turkeys when developing habitat management strategies. In addition to creating early successional habitat conditions by using prescribed fire, we recommend managers retain hardwoods and recognize the importance of shrub-scrub cover to management of turkey populations in longleaf pine savannas.

AB  - Seed dispersal is a key process in plant communities and frugivory is very important in vertebrate communities. This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed ungulates. For other animal taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - ContextWe studied current functional connectivity along a developing grassland corridor in the Midwestern U.S. and focused on connectivity for Greater Prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido). Greater Prairie-chickens are an area-sensitive species that rely on grasslands and are an indicator species for the tallgrass prairie ecosystem in North America. The coordinated multi-agency Prairie Landscape Conservation Plan is one of the largest planned and implemented conservation corridors in the U.S., making this system ideal to examine factors associated with corridor functionality.ObjectivesWe examined landscape functional connectivity and factors that impact genetic structure and gene flow of Greater Prairie-chickens to identify gaps in a planned prairie corridor that is currently being implemented.MethodsWe collected feathers from 81 leks and obtained 31 hunter-harvested wings. We used a landscape genetic approach to evaluate eight hypotheses to explain functional connectivity and examine impacts of land cover and land use on isolation and genetic structure.ResultsTwo populations were most supported based on 294 unique genotypes. Functional connectivity was influenced by land use, land cover, and anthropogenic development. Good connectivity exists within the Greater Prairie-chicken range, but improvements along the corridor in the northern portion of the extant range would be beneficial.ConclusionsWe produced geographically specific recommendations as to where land management can potentially achieve the greatest impact. Our results help prioritize areas for ongoing conservation efforts, like prairie acquisition, restoration, and enhancement. Furthermore, identification of factors influencing connectivity in our study can be applied to improve conservation planning elsewhere in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.

AB  - Wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations are broadly distributed, occupy a variety of habitats, and have demographic rates that are heterogeneous through space and time. Dynamics of turkey populations are sensitive to the magnitude of fall either-sex harvest, yet there have been few attempts to study performance of fall harvests systematically across a range of plausible demographic scenarios. Thus robustness of existing recommendations to structural uncertainty in population dynamics is marginally understood. We used a stochastic, sex-specific theta-logistic model to simulate performance of fall harvests (0-15%) across scenarios representing uncertainty about current rates of population productivity (3 levels), female losses during spring hunting (2 levels), and spring male harvest (3 levels), with uncertainty in the strength of density dependence as a common attribute. We demonstrated that performance of previously recommended fall harvests was not robust to changes in demographic parameters that occur within and among populations, and thus previous management recommendations may not be appropriate for all regions. Fall harvest rates capable of maintaining large populations with high probability varied from 0-6% with changes to population productivity, when median male and female spring harvests were 30% and 5%, respectively. In general, risks and management tradeoffs accompanying fall harvests were tightly linked to assumed values of population parameters, where changes to productivity and female loss had particularly strong effects on management outcomes. Specifically, reduced productivity or increased female loss decreased the ability to maintain large populations for a given fall harvest rate. Thus, fall harvest recommendations deduced from models that considered only a small portion of the demographic parameter space may not meet modern management objectives over a broader range of conditions. Moreover, our results suggest that future management could be improved by reducing structural uncertainty about turkey demography to allow for region-specific harvest strategies, or by using decision-theoretic approaches to identify harvest strategies that are robust to uncertainty about population parameters. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.        We used stochastic simulation to test the generality of currently accepted fall harvest guidelines for wild turkeys in the presence of uncertainty about system dynamics that is relevant to the modern era of turkey management. Current fall harvest recommendations are not robust to uncertainties that are ubiquitous to modern turkey management, and consideration of structural uncertainty in population dynamics should be explicitly incorporated into the development of turkey harvest strategies.

AB  - Many populations of wildlife, including large- and medium-sized predators are increasing in Europe. Trapping can be one way to reduce negative impacts of predators on human interests, such as game species and threatened species, but there is little knowledge of trap usage and motivation behind it. We used a mail survey in Sweden (n = 3,886 respondents) to compare predator trappers with hunters who used other methods to kill predators, and with other hunters who did not kill predators, in regard to sociodemographics, beliefs, behaviors, and constraints. During 12 months prior to the survey 19 % of respondents had trapped any small- or medium-sized predator, while 15 % of respondents had trapped and 55 % had hunted (without using traps) red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), or corvid birds. Reducing predator numbers was an important reason for hunting predators with traps. Of predator trappers, 97 % had hunted species that were potentially prey of the targeted predators (e.g., roe deer [Capreolus capreolus], hare [Lepus spp.], and grouse), 94 % believed that there were too many red foxes, badgers, or corvids on their main hunting ground, and 64 % believed it to be very important to reduce predator numbers to benefit other game species. We conclude that the use of traps is widespread among Swedish hunters, and that increasing wildlife populations, increased presence of wildlife in urban areas, and management of invasive species calls for effective management actions, of which trapping can be one.

AB  - The interaction between environmental variation and population dynamics is of major importance, particularly for managed and economically important species, and especially given contemporary changes in climate variability. Recent analyses of exploited animal populations contested whether exploitation or environmental variation has the greatest influence on the stability of population dynamics, with consequences for variation in yield and extinction risk. Theoretical studies however have shown that harvesting can increase or decrease population variability depending on environmental variation, and requested controlled empirical studies to test predictions. Here, we use an invertebrate model species in experimental microcosms to explore the interaction between selective harvesting and environmental variation in food availability in affecting the variability of stage-structured animal populations over 20 generations. In a constant food environment, harvesting adults had negligible impact on population variability or population size, but in the variable food environments, harvesting adults increased population variability and reduced its size. The impact of harvesting on population variability differed between proportional and threshold harvesting, between randomly and periodically varying environments, and at different points of the time series. Our study suggests that predicting the responses to selective harvesting is sensitive to the demographic structures and processes that emerge in environments with different patterns of environmental variation.

AB  - Habitat alteration to benefit hunted species has been implemented for centuries. These practices are most prevalent on public and private lands where management is funded through hunting licenses and hunting tourism. Habitat management for game species is globally widespread and can take diverse forms - e.g. tree reduction to enhance forage for deer in the United States and burning moorlands in Scotland to increase habitat for wading birds. Yet the effects of these practices on non-targeted animals are poorly understood. Given limited funding for conservation and increasing threats to biodiversity, understanding the shared benefits and unintended consequences of game management for other species is important. To quantify and characterize existing studies on this topic, we synthesized scientific literature that measured the effects of game management on non targeted animals. We found surprisingly few studies (n = 26), and the outcomes of these studies illustrated that, through diverse mechanisms, game management can have positive, negative or no effect on non-target taxa. Our analysis suggests that the explicit evaluation of the effects of game management on other species is rare but warranted, offering opportunities to advance ecological understanding and conservation of both target and non-target species. We propose a research agenda to fill knowledge gaps and catalyze a conversation about an approach to wildlife management that affects a large fraction of public and private land.

AB  - Population models are useful tools to guide management as they allow us to project growth and persistence of wildlife populations under different scenarios. Nevertheless, good data are needed to produce reliable models, and this requirement is problematic in some situations. North Island saddlebacks (Philesturnus rufusater) were reintroduced to Boundary Stream Mainland Island in September 2004, and this was the first time this species had occurred in an unfenced mainland area since their extirpation in the 19th century. This situation creates a challenging scenario for population modelling, as this species has never been studied in the presence of mainland predators, and management of these predators will be the key factor determining whether the population survives. In this paper we present an approach for developing a "prior model" before a reintroduction takes place. We use data from the reintroduced saddleback population on Mokoia Island to develop a model of how saddleback populations are regulated in the absence of mammalian predators. We use this model to project growth of a reintroduced population when vital rates are reduced by predation and also to project responses of source populations to harvesting of birds for translocation. We then incorporate data from the reintroduced North Island robin (Petroica longipes) population at Paengaroa Mainland Island to model the relationship between population parameters and predator tracking rates. The combined model can be used to predict the level of predator control needed to ensure growth of the saddleback population, but the prediction is contingent on guessing the relative Vulnerability of robins and saddlebacks to predation. We envision using a Bayesian approach to update such prior models as site-specific data become available after reintroduction.

AB  - Predators elicit antipredator behaviors such as proactive and reactive movements in prey, but both are rarely investigated simultaneously. Impacts of human predation risk on antipredator behaviors can be greater than those of nonhuman predators, resulting in increased effects on populations and community structure. We compared the influence of human and nonhuman predation risk on proactive and reactive antipredator movement behaviors of male Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo, hereafter turkey). We used simultaneously collected GPS locations from 31 turkeys and 36 coyotes (Canis latrans) to investigate the antipredator behavior of turkeys to coyotes. To assess antipredator behaviors of turkeys to hunters, we used 1661 hunting tracks collected while monitoring 109 turkeys. For proactive movements, we quantified how predation risk influenced resource selection. To investigate reactive movements, we quantified changes in movement behavior of turkeys after encountering hunters and coyotes. Coyote and turkey home range overlap was high, but lack of core area overlap, encounters, and similar resource selection suggested the use of different areas on the landscape. Turkeys selected areas associated with decreased coyote risk and closer to hardwoods. Coyotes preferred shrubs and open areas, suggesting turkeys avoided coyote risk and the habitats coyotes preferred. We detected 17 coyote and turkey contacts, and the probability of contact decreased by 16.6% for every 100 m farther from a forest edge. Turkeys did not display reactive movement behaviors after a direct encounter with coyotes, as step lengths were similar prior to and after encounters, which did not differ from random step lengths. After hunting, turkeys selected areas farther from public access points and closer to private property, suggesting proactive avoidance of hunter risk. We detected 31 hunter and turkey contacts; increased step lengths after hunter contacts suggested fleeing behavior. The probability of a hunter-turkey contact decreased by 5.5% for every 100 m farther from a secondary road. Antipredator movement behaviors by turkeys suggest coyote risk to be low over a broad temporal window, while hunter risk is high for a narrow temporal window. We provide insight into how human-induced fear can cause antipredator behavioral responses greater than nonhuman fear, potentially causing changes in species distribution and community structure.

AB  - Until recently, most contemporary ecologists have ignored or diminished anecdotal historical accounts and anthropologists' reports about aboriginal fire in the Great Basin. Literature review shows that Indians practiced regular use of fire for many purposes, including the obvious reasons of increasing the availability of desired plants, maintaining habitats for animals used as food, and driving game during hunts. Historical accounts of prehistoric anthropogenic firing, inferences from fire-scar data, and data regarding annual production capability of representative sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-perennial grass ecological sites indicate that prehistoric conditions were neither fuel- nor ignition-limited. According to many sources, this "active management" by Indians was widespread, significant, and more common than lightning-caused fires, resulting in mosaic vegetation patterns that subsequently moderated the behavior of "natural fires." This interaction between Indian-burning and lightning fires may have strongly influenced the pre-Euro-American settlement vegetation of the Great Basin. At the very least, the landscape was a patchwork of areas altered by aboriginal people and areas shaped primarily by bio-physical processes. Based on this prehistoric precedent, current historically unprecedented conditions (fuel load and exotic weed invasion threats), and predicted climate change, contemporary active management of sagebrush-perennial grass communities is paramount. Restoration measures should be scientifically based and tailored to achieve ecological resilience and functionality in specific sites. Prescribed fire is not always ecologically appropriate or judicious, especially in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata spp. wyomingensis) communities, so managers should consider using other alternatives where an intentional low severity distubance is deemed necessary. Properly planned active management would disrupt fuel continuity for lighthning fires, ensure ecological process and successional integrity, and benefit multiple uses on a landscape scale.

AB  - Management of hunting activity to serve as a tool for sustainable development has become a key issue in conservation biology. However, little evidence is available showing positive impacts of hunting on ecosystem conservation, limiting its capability to be used as a conservation tool. We analysed hunting and its positive influence on the ecology and conservation of the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), a scavenger with a relevant function in the ecosystem, in the Cantabrian Mountains, NW Spain. Use of the area by vultures was addressed by looking for cliffs used as roosts or colonies, and consumption of game species by vultures was evaluated through field surveys and questionnaires to hunters. Results revealed a strong spatiotemporal adjustment in the use of the area by vultures and hunting events, especially of red deer and wild boar. Vultures occupied roosting sites very close to the main hunting sectors of these game species and often were seen consuming their carcasses. The spatiotemporal pattern of roost use by vultures strongly overlapped with hunting of red deer. The numbers of both red deer and wild boar hunting episodes within 3.5 km around the roosts were the best predictors of vulture occurrence and number. Our estimates show that hunting could feed around 1,800 vultures/6 months. Hunting can thus influence species at the top of the ecosystem (scavengers) and could aid sustainable management of griffon vulture populations, reconciling hunting and conservation. However, negative and positive impacts should be taken into account simultaneously for an overall evaluation of hunting on ecosystem conservation.

AB  - Dynamic zoning (systematic alteration in the spatial and temporal allocation of even-aged forest management practices) has been proposed as a means to change the spatial pattern of timber harvest across a landscape to maximize forest interior habitat while holding timber harvest levels constant. Simulation studies have established that dynamic zoning strategies produce larger tracts of interior, closed canopy forest, thus increasing the value of these landscapes for interior-dependent wildlife. We used the simulation model LANDIS to examine how the implementation of a dynamic zoning strategy would change trajectories of ecological succession in the Great Divide Ranger District of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin over 500 years. The components of dynamic zoning strategies (number of zones in a scenario and the length of the hiatus between successive entries into zones) and their interaction had highly significant impacts on patterns of forest succession. Dynamic zoning scenarios with more zones and shorter hiatus lengths increased the average amount of the forest dominated by early successional aspen (Populus sp.). Dynamic zoning scenarios with two zones produced more late successional mature northern hardwoods than scenarios with four zones. Dynamic zoning scenarios with very short (30 years) or very long (120 years) hiatus lengths resulted in more late successional mature northern hardwoods than scenarios with intermediate hiatus lengths (60 and 90 years). However, none of the dynamic scenarios produced as much late successional mature northern hardwoods as the static alternative. Furthermore, the amounts of all habitat types in all dynamic zoning scenarios fluctuated greatly in time and space relative to static alternatives, which could negatively impact wildlife species that require a stable amount of habitat above some minimum critical threshold. Indeed, implementing dynamic zoning scenarios of different designs would have both positive and negative effects on wildlife species and for other objectives of forest management.

AB  - Weather conditions can have a significant influence on short-term fluctuations of animal populations. In our study, which is based on time series of hunting bag records of up to 28 years from 26 counties of The Netherlands and Germany, we investigated the impact of different weather variables on annual counts of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and European hares (Lepus europaeus). Overall, the long-term dynamics of both species could be described by higher-order polynomials. On a smaller time scale, the number of European hares shot was lower in years with higher amounts of precipitation during late summer/autumn, and the number of European rabbits shot was lower in years with high precipitation in spring of the respective year. We suggest that rainy weather conditions might have lowered the survival of young rabbits in spring and might have generally facilitated the outbreak or spread of diseases in rabbits as well as in hares, specifically in autumn. In addition, the results showed a time-delayed, interactive effect between precipitation in spring and winter weather on European rabbit dynamics: rabbit numbers were limited by low temperatures of the prior winter season, but only when precipitation was high during spring of the previous year. The latter result might be explained by the lowering effects of rainy spring weather on the body condition of the animals, leading to higher sensitivity to harsh winter conditions. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for the impact of weather conditions on the population dynamics of both study species and particularly highlights complex interactions between the prevailing weather conditions during different seasons in the European rabbit.

AB  - Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are one of the most toxic groups of compounds currently used worldwide for rodent pest control. Toxic baits are often, directly or indirectly, ingested by non-target animals, resulting in secondary poisoning and frequently affecting apex predators. Their presence in many species of raptors is quite common, particularly scavenger species, with some of these acting as sentinels for the presence of these substances in the environment. However, there is less data on the presence of ARs in Bonelli's eagle, one of the most endangered eagle species in Spain and which is experiencing a negative population trend in Europe. This medium-sized eagle feeds predominantly on live species, and rarely consumes carrion. In this study, 17 carcasses of Bonelli's eagles from the Eastern Spain were necropsied. Both first and second generation ARs in their livers were analyzed by HPLC-MS-TOF revealing that all the eagles studied had been exposed to at least 5 ARs, out of a total of 10 ARs analyzed, with 7 being the highest number of ARs detected in a sample. Second generation ARs were the most prevalent, particularly bromadiolone and brodifacoum, with the highest concentrations in 94% of the cases. More than a third of the eagles presented a liver concentration of greater than 200 ng/g ARs, suggesting AR poisoning. The elevated presence of these compounds in Bonelli's eagles could be a new cause of mortality for this species or could explain other causes of death, such as the increased mortality in power lines, and should be taken into account for their conservation. At the same time, the presence of these compounds in the environment also represents a risk to public health, as the most frequent species in the diet of Bonelli's eagle (rabbits and partridges) are also hunted and consumed by hunters and their families.

AB  - Invasive winter annual grasses such as downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) are a threat to native ecosystems throughout the United States. Downy brome is able to exploit moisture and nutrients throughout the fall and early spring before native plants break dormancy. This results in decreased native species abundance and development of monotypic downy brome stands. Short-term downy brome management has been shown to be effective; however, the soil seed reserve has often been overlooked, although it's the mechanism responsible for rapid reestablishment. This field study was conducted at two sites in Colorado to evaluate the longevity of the downy brome soil seed reserve and its implications on long-term downy brome control. Glyphosate plus adjuvant applications were made for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 consecutive years. Downy brome and perennial grass biomass harvests were conducted yearly to determine changes in species composition. In addition, soil cores were collected to evaluate the yearly variation and depletion of the downy brome soil seed bank in response to consecutive glyphosate applications. We found that 1-3 yr of consecutive glyphosate treatments were insufficient to deplete the downy brome soil seed bank. Downy brome biomass and the soil seed bank recovered within 1-2 yr after glyphosate treatments were terminated; however, 4 and 5 consecutive yr of glyphosate applications were sufficient to control downy brome through depletion of the soil seed bank. Managing downy brome for 4-5 consecutive yr resulted in a 4- to 9-fold increase in perennial grass biomass. These data suggest that long-term management of downy brome is dependent on eliminating the soil seed bank using a multiyear approach. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - The ingestion of spent Pb shot due to confusion with grit or inadvertently with food particles causes Pb poisoning in a large number of waterbirds, this being one of the main causes of mortality for some species. Lead ammunition for hunting is being progressively banned in more countries, while grit supplementation has been proposed as a management measure to reduce the ingestion of deposited Pb shot. Studies of grit selection with waterfowl in semi-captivity and in the wild were undertaken to evaluate preferences in the colour and geochemical composition of grit, whether it was available dry or in water, its position within the wetland and the relationship between grit ingestion and feeding behaviour. Grit ingestion was higher when food was included in the treatments. In the absence of food, red grit was taken in higher amounts than grey in semi-captivity but not in the wild. Siliceous grit was taken in a higher amount than calcareous when offered dry, but not in water. No differences in the amount of ingested grit were found among different positions within the wetland. The number of feeding attempts in plots supplemented with grit was higher than in those without grit, although the highest numbers of feeding birds were found in plots supplemented with food. Grit ingestion in waterfowl is intimately associated with feeding behaviour. To optimize the effectiveness of grit supplementation to reduce the risk of Pb poisoning in waterfowl, calcareous and siliceous grit may be combined and applied in feeding sites or mixed with bait to attract birds.

AB  - Within the sagebrush steppe ecosystem, sagebrush plants influence a number of ecosystem properties, including nutrient distribution, plant species diversity, soil moisture, and temperature, and provide habitat for a wide variety of wildlife species. Recent increases in frequency and size of wildfires and associated annual grass expansion within the Wyoming big sagebrush alliance have increased the need for effective sagebrush restoration tools and protocols. Our objectives were to quantify the success of Wyoming big sagebrush transplants relative to transplant stock (nursery seedlings vs. wildlings) across different ecological sites and vegetation types and to test the hypothesis that reduction of herbaceous vegetation would increase survival of transplanted sagebrush. We used a randomized block (reps=5) design at each of three sites-1) cheatgrass dominated, 2) native plant dominated, and 3) crested wheatgrass dominated-near Elko, Nevada. Treatments included plant stock (nursery stock or locally harvested wildlings) and herbicide (glyphosate) to reduce competition from herbaceous vegetation. Transplants were planted in the spring of 2009 and 2010 and monitored for survival. Data were analyzed for site and treatment effects using mixed-model ANOVA. Surviving plant density at and 2 yr postplanting was generally highest (up to 3-fold) on the native site (P < 0.05). Density of surviving transplants was almost 3-fold higher for nursery stock on most sites for the 2009 planting, but differences in survival by planting stock were minimal for the 2010 planting. Glyphosate application increased surviving plant density up to 300% (depending on site) for both years of planting. High labor and plant material investments (relative to traditional drilling or broadcasting) may limit the size of projects for which sagebrush transplants are practical, but these costs may be partially offset by high success relative to traditional methods. Our data indicate that sagebrush transplants can be effective for establishing sagebrush on depleted sites.

AB  - The brown hare (Lepus europaeus) expanded its Swedish distribution since the 1980s northwards and locally to new areas within its former range. Of 115 brown hare populations within the former range reported in a hunter enquiry, those established after 1980 were situated higher above the sea level than older ones and higher than neighbouring (< 50 km) older populations. Reports on increased use of forest habitats by brown hares were equally frequent among recent and older populations, suggesting a process promoted solely by less harsh winters. Supposed hare hybrids were more often reported from hunting grounds with recent brown hare establishment, i.e. where the species expands in time and in space. In a 27-year dataset on brown hare observations, the recent increased use of forest habitats was supported in that maximum distances to agricultural land for brown hare sightings were higher in mild winters, whereas the proportions of the annual observations made during winter were lower. In 40-year bag records from two Swedish counties, the dynamics of the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) responded positively to snow parameters, whereas brown hares responded negatively. We suggest that the state of mountain hare populations primarily depends on winter conditions and predation pressure, whereas possible effects of hybridization are unclear. If winter conditions remain as in the last 15 years, mountain hare numbers are not likely to increase in southern Sweden, whereas the brown hare may expand even further. In either case, hybrids will occur in sympatric areas in frequencies probably related to the density of the respective true species.

AB  - ContextNumerous wildlife species use a polygynous mating system, where males use auditory courtship behaviors to secure breeding opportunities. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis, risk reward, and landscape of fear theories suggest spatial variation in male auditory courtship will be influenced by areas in landscapes where sound transmission is increased, and predation risk is reduced. However, it is often unclear what landscape features drive spatial variation in courtship behaviors.ObjectivesWe quantified the influence of predation risk, land cover type, and resource selection on spatial trends in the auditory courtship behavior (gobbling activity) of Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris).MethodsWe used 53,025 gobbles coupled with GPS locations from 111 turkeys and 36 coyotes (Canis latrans), and distance metrics associated with hunter activity and land cover type, to investigate influences of predation risk, resource selection, and land cover type on spatial variation in gobbling activity in Georgia, USA.ResultsDistance to public access during hunting was the most influential predictor of gobbling activity, wherein the expected number of daily gobbles increased by 40% for every 500 m farther from public access. Daily gobbles decreased by 22% for every 500 m farther away from private property during hunting. We failed to find significant effects of land cover type and coyote use but found limited evidence that areas with increased predicted probability of turkey use was associated with increased gobbling.ConclusionsPredation risk associated with increased anthropogenic disturbance had the greatest influence on gobbling activity. Our findings suggest that altering hunter access by closing roads to vehicle use, reducing hunter activity, or creating refuge areas on the landscape could positively influence gobbling activity.

AB  - Conservation conflicts often involve tensions between human stakeholders. One highly topical conflict is that around migratory bird hunting in the Mediterranean, particularly in Malta. Here, tensions between hunters and anti-hunting groups have escalated to include rural surveillance operations by anti-hunting groups, physical scuffles with hunters, retaliatory poaching and measures unheard of in Europe, such as the use of drones or army interventions. We describe the historical and political background to the Maltese conflict and use social network analysis to map the institutional relationships between governmental and non-governmental stakeholders influencing hunting in Malta. Our analysis confirms that the institutional landscape is highly polarised with two distinctive sides with few links between them. Nonetheless there are links between organisations in opposite sides of the spectrum and these could be explored to improve dialogue between the hunting and anti-hunting lobby. We also uncover that the ORNIS committee, the state's single hunting consultative platform lacks brokering power, the ability to connect otherwise unconnected groups within a network, which is likely why those opposed to spring hunting have recently started campaigning for a national referendum on the issue. Although independent monitoring is urgently needed around the Mediterranean, if science is to contribute to the management of this conflict, it will only be useful if the current stakeholder polarisation is overcome. Important steps towards conflict resolution include anti-hunting groups improving their ability to distinguish clearly between species conservation and animal welfare, and the ability of hunting groups to co-ordinate themselves better to ensure compliance with the law amongst their membership.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of population fluctuations is a central goal of ecology. Although well-established theory suggests that parasites can drive cyclic population fluctuations in their hosts, field evidence is lacking. Theory predicts that a parasite that loosely aggregates in the host population and has stronger impact on host fecundity than survival should induce cycling. The helminth Trichostrongylus retortaeformis in the UK's only native lagomorph, the mountain hare, has exactly these properties, and the hares exhibit strong population fluctuations. Here we use a host-parasite model parametrized using the available empirical data to test this superficial concordance between theory and observation. In fact, through an innovative combination of sensitivity and stability analyses, we show that hare population cycles do not seem to be driven by the parasite. Potential limitations in our parametrization and model formulation, together with the possible secondary roles for parasites in determining hare demography, are discussed. Improving our knowledge of leveret biology and the quantification of harvesting emerge as future research priorities. With the growing concern over the present management of mountain hares for disease control in Scotland, understanding their population drivers is an important prerequisite for the effective management of this species.

AB  - The interacting effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation on wildlife are of global conservation concern. Over the past four decades, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) populations in North Dakota have been exposed to severe winter weather, drought, predation, harvest, and rapid oil and gas development. Adult pronghorn counts in North Dakota fluctuated over time with an increasing trend from 1974 to 2007, followed by a rapid decline from 2008 to 2012. Our primary objective was to identify key drivers of an index of pronghorn abundance in western North Dakota over this period to inform conservation and management. Despite missing data, Bayesian mixed-effects models allowed us to analyze variation in annual population count data relative to weather conditions, coyote populations, oil and gas development, human harvest, and agricultural practices. We found that lower indices of abundance corresponded with heavy snowfall and low winter temperatures, suggesting that the large observed decline starting in 2008 was primarily due to severe winter weather conditions. We also found that the abundance index was negatively correlated with road and oil/gas well density, of which the latter increased exponentially during the last decade. In contrast, we found little evidence that coyote populations, drought, and human harvest were major drivers of observed population declines. Based on these findings, we expect that pronghorn populations will be negatively influenced by the anticipated increase in winter storm frequency and continued expansion of oil and gas development. Roads, fences, and development may impede pronghorn movement to more hospitable areas during winter storms, thereby hindering their ability to escape extreme conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is an endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula and is essential for the conservation of endangered predators. Rabbits are also of high importance as a hunting species. From 1988, rabbits suffered the severe effects of rabbit hemorrhagic disease, which caused large declines in most populations. Despite this fact, the National Red Data Lists continued to classify rabbits as a "Least Concern" species. We used available hunting bag data from 1973 to 2002 to model national trends of rabbit abundance and to evaluate the conservation status according to the criteria of the National Red Data List and the World Conservation Union (IUCN). Generalized Additive Models were used as the statistical framework. The rabbit population of Spain suffered a large decline of about 71% between 1973 and 1993. This decline was 49% in the period 1980-1990. Based on both Spanish and World Conservation Union criteria, rabbits should be listed as 'Vulnerable', which demands a Conservation Plan Program. We suggest that the lack of concordance between the best available evidence and the conservation status of the species is a consequence of sociological constraints in conservation decisions. Rabbit conservation could face strong opposition from important socio-economic lobby groups (hunters and farmers). As such, governments and researchers may prefer to exclude rabbits from any status category requiring conservation action, despite the evidence of decline. We call for the urgent development of a nation-wide conservation program for rabbits which includes both socioeconomic constraints and the available biological data on population trends.

AB  - Context. Stress or injury resulting from capture and marking of animals is a potential cause of mortality following release. Multiple methods have been developed to identify sources of post-capture mortality, but these are most often applied following completion of field work to identify an appropriate censor window for other analyses. Aims. Following unacceptable levels of post-capture mortality (13 of 53) in radio-marked individuals in the first year of a larger wild turkey research project in Maine, USA, we assessed post-capture survival as data became available to inform proactive changes to capture protocols, with the goals of improving animal welfare and data quality. Methods. We evaluated potential sources of post-capture mortality related to the capture and marking process, individual characteristics of the turkey, and local weather conditions. We then used results from the preliminary analysis to inform adaptive changes to capture protocols in subsequent years and confirmed the effectiveness of these changes through a final analysis. Key results. We found that greater handling time was positively correlated with increased post-capture survival, possibly in response to releasing turkeys in larger groups to facilitate regrouping. We also found that transmitter style impacted post-capture survival, such that female turkeys fitted with backpack-style transmitters experienced a survival rate of 0.787 (0.677-0.861 95% CI), compared with 0.903 (0.538-0.976 95% CI) for those fitted with a necklace transmitter, although adjustments to the fit of backpack transmitters appeared to help mitigate such issues. Conclusions. Following informed adjustments to our capture protocols, we observed a dramatic increase in post-capture survival such that no mortalities were experienced in the first 30 days post capture in the final year of our study (n = 65). Although our estimated censor window was similar to other studies (similar to 10 days), differences in effects of external stressors further the need for adaptive capture protocols because local stressors and risks may vary according to climate and ecosystem characteristics such as predator communities and habitat type. Implications. We recommend that when possible, investigators continuously assess their protocols throughout the capture process and adapt accordingly to limit negative repercussions of capture and handling to wildlife.

AB  - The Arctic supports a diversity of breeding birds. Since the mid-twentieth century, anthropogenic-source climate change, industrial activity and harvest have impacted this ecosystem and the demographics of its breeding birds, highlighting the need to synthesise current knowledge. A scoping review was conducted to quantify recent population trends and identify impacts of anthropogenic activity on species' demography. The literature revealed that many seabird trends were mixed or uncertain. Trends among waterfowl, divers and cranes were largely upward or stable. Trends among waders, passerines and raptors, however, were more evenly distributed upward and downward. Wader trends tended to be more positive in the East Atlantic flyway compared to other flyways, while many raptor populations are recovering following historic losses. In contrast, grouse experienced uncertain or negative trends. Weather regime and vegetation shifts, phenological mismatches and diminishing sea ice associated with climate change are important drivers of demography. The strength and direction of these impacts, however, varies among guilds and between the low and high-Arctic. The extraction, chemical, agriculture and fisheries industries also impact demography. Research on heavy metal and organochlorine contamination was prevalent in the literature, despite having relatively weaker impacts than other drivers. Although bird harvest has had profound impacts on Arctic populations, recently updated regulations and improvements in policy have ameliorated its impact somewhat. Nonetheless, many anthropogenic impacts are predicted to become more severe in the future, with consequences for breeding bird trends, therefore continued pan-Arctic monitoring and addressing knowledge gaps will be necessary to preserve this unique biome.

AB  - 1. Game bird management has the potential to benefit conservation, as management practices specifically targeted at reducing the factors limiting game populations may have positive effects on non-game species. However, such management may also have costs to species.        2. We review the literature that examines the effect of different forms of game bird management on non-target species in Europe, including habitat management, predator control, parasite control, provision of water and food and rear and release. We focus on Europe, where these forms of management are common and sometimes intensive.        3. We identified 35 studies, which recorded 122 individual significant effects. Most studies (80%) focussed on the effects of habitat management and predator control, and >90% were carried out in the UK.        4. 63% of the 122 significant effects on non-game species were positive. Overall, 85% of the effects of habitat management in agricultural habitats were positive, while in non-agricultural habitats 65% of effects were negative. Effects of rear and release were mixed (8 positive and 7 negative). Legal predator control was almost always positive (96% of effects), or benign, whereas illegal predator control was always negative (8 effects). This continues to be a major cost to conservation. No studies examined the effects of parasite control on non-target wildlife. Three of four significant effects of supplementary feeding were negative.        5. More studies are needed on the impacts of game bird management on non-game species, and particularly of rear and release, the provision of supplementary food and water, and parasite control. We also found few experimental studies examining the specific effects of management for shooting of game birds, and very few studies overall outside the UK. Future studies should aim to fill these gaps.

AB  - The poisoning of wild animals by lead (Pb) ammunition fired by hunters has been known for many decades, especially in the case of waterbirds. More recently, it has been demonstrated that raptors are also exposed to the risk of plumbism when feeding on unretrieved quarry that was wounded or killed by hunters. Further studies reveal that even humans can be subject to a significant Pb dose while consuming game animals killed by traditional ammunition. Given the relevance of this issue, several pieces of research have been carried out to assess frequency, dimension, and the number of Pb fragments embedded in the carcasses of ungulates, partridges, ducks, and other birds to evaluate the risk related to the consumption of game meat. In spite of their great importance as quarry species across southern Europe, until now, no data have been available on small passerines. To assess the quantity and type of Pb embedded in songbirds, we x-rayed 196 starlings shot in Italy and found Pb pellets and/or visible fragments in 118 carcasses (60.2 %). We counted 128 shotgun pellets in 85 carcasses. In 28 birds, we detected both whole pellets and lead fragments; in 33, we found only small fragments. By excising and weighing a sample of 20 shotgun pellets (diameter 1.35-1.99 mm), we calculated a Pb load of 3.75 g in the whole sample of 196 starlings, corresponding to an average of 27.32 mg/100 g of body weight. This is a conservative estimation, because fragments were not considered. Compared to game birds of a larger size, the starlings in our study had a lower amount of embedded Pb, but the shot pellets and fragments embedded in their tissues were abundant and tiny. Given the results of previous studies, the quantity and level of fragmentation suggest that the risk of Pb poisoning cannot be ruled out for humans and birds of prey consuming the meat from songbirds killed with traditional ammunition.

AB  - Current methods for determining plant age of shrub species require destructive sampling and annual growth ring analysis on the primary stem. Although individual plant ages can frequently be determined in this manner, the method is time consuming and of limited value for plants that have lost stem wood from stem splitting and rot. Nondestructive methods for estimating big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) plant age would be useful in assessing stand age structure and population dynamics at variable spatial scales. The purpose of this study was to test a suite of traits for potential use in estimating mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana [Rydb.] Beetle) age. We evaluated traits including plant height, crown area, subcanopy litter depth, percent crown mortality, bark furrow depth, bark fiber length, circumference and diameter of plant basal stem, and circumference of secondary and tertiary branches. We measured and harvested basal cross-sections from 163 plants of varying sizes from five locations in central and south-central Utah. Plant age was determined from annual growth rings. Linear regression analyses revealed that stem diameter (r(2) = 0.507 P < 0.0001) was the most highly correlated variable with plant age across all sites, followed by stem circumference (r(2) = 0.474 P < 0.0001), secondary branch circumference (r(2) = 0.360, P < 0.0001), tertiary branch circumference (r(2) = 0.405, P < 0.0001), and bark fiber length (r(2) = 0.373, P < 0.0001). Results support previous findings that stem girth has value for estimating mountain big sagebrush plant age and that this trait is a better indicator of age than any other tested traits. Although the relationship between stem diameter and plant age was significant, substantial stem size variability associated with plants of the same approximate age indicates that the method is most appropriate when precise age estimates are not required. This technique was developed specifically for mountain big sagebrush, but it is expected that it can be adapted for other sagebrush taxa. (C) 2019 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - An index of upland wildlife habitat was developed to investigate patterns and changes in habitat over time, using four years (1920, 1940, 1964, 1987) and the state of Illinois as an example. The index was composed of two subdivisions that described, at the county level, the quantity of wildlife habitat and a third subdivision that described farming disturbances that impacted the quality of the habitat. Data came from the US Census of Agriculture. The first subdivision that reflected quantity of habitat was called the wildlife habitat subdivision and was the sum of percentage woodland on farms, percentage farmland in nonrow crops, and percentage farmland in set-aside programs. The second subdivision that reflected the quantity of habitat was termed the soil-related features subdivision and was the sum of the percentage of farmland that was not highly erodible, the percentage of farmland in soil-protecting crops, and the percentage of farmland in conservation tillage. The third subdivision, reflecting the quality of the habitat, was the farming disturbance subdivision and was the sum of the percentage of grazing and the percentage of land on which fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides were applied. Overall, major decreases occurred between 1920 and 1987 in the subdivisions reflecting the quantity of wildlife habitat and a major increase occurred in the subdivision associated with farming disturbance, reflecting the intensification of agriculture in the state. However, there was variability throughout the stale, with some counties being more favorable to wildlife (as measured by the subdivisions) than others. Most of the changes within the state for the subdivisions reflecting quantity of upland wildlife habitat occurred during 1940 while changes in the farming disturbance subdivision (reflecting habitat quality) occurred in 1964. By 1987, the western and southern parts of Illinois were the most favorable for wildlife as reflected in all three subdivisions. Upland wildlife harvest indices were related to the subdivisions in 1964 and 1987, when harvest indices were available. Cottontail and northern bobwhite harvests were higher in counties with higher amounts of the wildlife habitat subdivision in both years. Cottontail harvest was also higher in counties with lower levels of the farming disturbance subdivision in 1964 and higher levels of soil-related features subdivision in 1987. Indices at the county level have the potential to be used in a multiscale analysis to investigate the impact of policy changes on large-scale areas of the Midwest and to develop regional perspectives of the impacts of agriculture on upland wildlife and their habitats.

AB  - Because the relationship between lead pellet availability and ingestion by mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) remains uncertain, we conducted an experiment to determine if doves held in captivity freely ingest lead shotgun pellets, investigate the relationship between pellet density and ingestion and monitor physiological impacts of doves ingesting pellets. We conducted two trials of the experiment with < 60 doves per trial. We randomly assigned 10 doves to one of six groups per trial; 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 pellets mixed with food and a control group with no pellets. We monitored ingestion by examining x-rays of doves 1-d post-treatment and monitored the effects of lead ingestion by measuring heterophil: lymphocyte (H:L) ratios, packed-cell volume (PCV), blood lead, liver lead and kidney lead. Pooled data from both trials showed 6 of 117 (5.1%) doves ingested lead pellets. Two mourning doves ingested multiple lead pellets in each of the treatments containing a mixture of 25, 100 and 200 lead pellets and food. Doves ingesting lead pellets had higher blood lead levels than before treatment (P = 0.031). Post-treatment H:L ratios, however, were not different compared to pre-treatment values (P = 0.109). Although post-treatment PCV decreased for four of six doves ingesting lead pellets, overall they were not lower than their pre-treatment values (P = 0.344). Liver (P < 0.0001) and kidney (P = 0.0012) lead levels for doves ingesting pellets were higher than doves without ingested pellets. Our lead pellet ingestion rates were similar to previously reported ingestion rates from hunter-killed doves and our physiological measurements confirm earlier reports of a rapid and acute lead toxicosis. Similar to previous field research, we did not observe a relationship between pellet density in the food and ad libitum pellet ingestion. Although one approach would be to ban lead shot for mourning dove hunting on managed public hunting areas, further research is necessary to ensure that policy development and implementation have a consensus among stakeholders.

AB  - There are no agricultural activities in Hungarian energy grass plantations (Elymus elongatus (Host) Runemark before harvesting in August, so the breeding success of the ground-nesting Common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) and Common quail (Coturnix coturnix (L.)) is probably higher than in the neighbouring intensively managed grain fields. The dominant nest predators of these bird species (e.g. Red fox Vulpes vulpes L.) prey mostly on small mammals, thus the abundance of small mammals can influence the survival rates of ground-nesting birds. These assumptions were tested using artificial ground-nests and small mammal live traps in late May 2005. Of the nests, 25 were placed in the energy grass field which covered 60 ha and another 25 in the wheat field which area was 20 ha. Each of the nests contained one chicken egg, one quail egg and one plasticine dummy-egg. Real eggs were placed for the evaluation of nest predation rates and artificial plasticine eggs for predator identification from tooth and bill imprints. Following the placement of artificial nests, they were checked repeatedly between 16.00 and 18.00 every day. In both plots, 25 traps were set up, baited for 4 nights with quail egg and for another 4 nights with plasticine egg. Artificial nests lasted for 3 days in the wheat field and for 4 days in the energy grass field. The major predators in wheat were birds (16%) and mammals (84%), whereas in energy grass all predation (100%) was caused by mammals. There was no significant difference between types of predators in the two habitats. On-spot observations, traces and marks left on plasticine eggs, several droppings and the patterns of nest predation all suggested that the majority of nests were destroyed by Red fox. A significantly higher proportion of plasticine eggs were damaged in wheat (80%) than in energy grass (48%). Based on marks left on plasticine eggs, small mammal abundance was higher in wheat (80%) than in energy grass (33%), the latter habitat not yielding any small mammal captures at all. Traps in the wheat field caught significantly more small mammals with plasticine eggs (14) than with quail eggs (5). Plasticine eggs had greater attraction effect on small mammals, thus could negatively influence experiments with artificial ground nests.

AB  - Top predators have cascading effects throughout the food web, but their impacts on scavenger abundance are largely unknown. Gray wolves (Canis lupus) provide carrion to a suite of scavenger species, including the common raven (Corvus corax). Ravens are wide-ranging and intelligent omnivores that commonly take advantage of anthropogenic food resources. In areas where they overlap with wolves, however, ravens are numerous and ubiquitous scavengers of wolf-acquired carrion. We aimed to determine whether subsidies provided through wolves are a limiting factor for raven populations in general and how the wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park in 1995-1997 affected raven population abundance and distribution on the Yellowstone's Northern Range specifically. We counted ravens throughout Yellowstone's Northern Range in March from 2009 to 2017 in both human-use areas and wolf habitat. We then used statistics related to the local wolf population and the winter weather conditions to model raven abundance during our study period and predict raven abundance on the Northern Range both before and after the wolf reintroduction. In relatively severe winters with greater snowpack, raven abundance increased in areas of human use and decreased in wolf habitat. When wolves were able to acquire more carrion, however, ravens increased in wolf habitat and decreased in areas with anthropogenic resources. Raven populations prior to the wolf reintroduction were likely more variable and heavily dependent on ungulate winter-kill and hunter-provided carcasses. The wolf recovery in Yellowstone helped stabilize raven populations by providing a regular food supply, regardless of winter severity. This stabilization has important implications for effective land management as wolves recolonize the west and global climate patterns change.

AB  - This paper assesses the vulnerability of Asiatic black bear to poaching in a key ecological zone in Northern Pakistan. Evidence about black bear hunting and cubs poaching were collected from Siran and Kaghan valleys of district Mansehra, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province through three different methods including participants' observations, interviews from key informants and structured questionnaire. We find local community members of both valleys to be active observers of hunting and poaching in the study area. The structured interviews with locals of the study area revealed striking facts about ongoing trafficking by hunters and traders of the neighboring districts (i.e. Kohistan and Battagram). The study identifies a tribe known as Maddi Khel in the neighboring district Battagram the member of which regularly travel to the study area for hunting of black bear, pheasants, gray goral and snow leopard. According to interviews with the local people, hunters and traders in groups from 10 to 25 persons with their own poaching arrangements including guns, pistols and well-trained domesticated dogs were seen every winter. For hunters in the study area, the main target was the killing of female black bear because killing of mothers allows them to poach their cubs. We also identify the routes i.e. Raam Gali, Door Gali, and Kunda Gali through which hunters enter from the neighboring districts Kohistan and Battagram for the purpose of poaching. During each four months season (December to March), on average, approximately 2-5 mothers are killed that carry 12 to 20 cubs. The small cubs have higher black-market demand in different cities in Pakistan that motivates hunters to continue poaching in the study area. Despite the conservation claims by the government department in the province, the ground survey reveals severe risk to the population of black bear from hunting and illegal trafficking. The government's wildlife department staff is less equipped to tackle with hunters in winter due to the extreme weather conditions in the area and their inability to stay for longer time.

AB  - We review the indexed scientific literature (233 papers) dealing with 'restocking' of vertebrates, i.e. reinforcement of wild populations by release of individuals of the same species. We found evidence that restocking may have desired beneficial effects such as: increased genetic diversity and mitigation of Allee effects in small populations; increased size or even salvation of threatened populations; increased harvest opportunities; and, redirection of harvest pressure from wild to captive-bred individuals. However, restocking may also have negative effects like changes in behaviour, morphology, and demography in recipient populations, as well as enhancement of pathogen spread. Negative genetic effects on recipient populations include homogenisation, introduction of non-native genes, and loss of local adaptation. Research thus far is strongly biased towards birds and mammals, and geographically to Europe and North America. Restocking for conservation purposes has been studied more than that for harvest management, while the latter may be of far greater importance in terms of number of released individuals. Demographic and genetic effects have been studied more than effects on behaviour, which in turn have received more attention than effects on morphology and pathogen spread. There is a general tendency for research on restocking to be fragmented taxonomically and by biological sub-disciplines. Our review demonstrates that restocking practices may and do cause significant disruptions of natural patterns in wild recipient populations. It also highlights the diversity, frequency and extent of these activities, leading us to argue that restocking is an emerging conservation and ecosystem resilience issue of global significance. Based on this review we outline monitoring and research needs for the future. We also provide guidelines to practitioners in conservation, game management, fisheries, epidemiology and other fields involved in restocking of vertebrates, who are likely to benefit from merging their perspectives and adopting a more cross-taxonomical and interdisciplinary attitude when laying out future agendas for evaluation and policy-making in this field.

AB  - Improvement of breeding Success is key to capercaillie Tetrao urogallus conservation in Scotland. However, factors affecting breeding success are not fully understood, including the cause of nest loss. We monitored 20 capercaillie nests with video or digital cameras at Abernethy Forest, Scotland to measure nest loss, determine causes of losses, and describe nest attendance by females. The mean date for the onset of incubation was 15 May and mean clutch size was 7.25 eggs. During incubation, Females usually left the nest twice a day (range: 0-4), on average 28 minutes after sunrise and 2 hours 13 minutes before sunset, for a total of 53 minutes per day. There were no egg losses during egg laying, and the daily loss of clutches during incubation (26 days) was 0.0427 (95% CI=0.0191-0.0663). However, an experiment with artificial nests Suggested that predation rates were higher where video cameras were installed than at nests where they were not. After adjusting for the potential effect of deployment of the video system, the daily loss of the capercaillie nests was 0.0205 (95% CI=0.0074-0.0554). Thus, the probability of a nest failing was 0.68 (950% CI=0.39-0.83, unadjusted) or 0.42 (95% CI=0.18-0.77, adjusted). This adjusted estimate at Abernethy Forest was close to the mid-range of other studies of capercaillie nest loss in Scotland and elsewhere in Europe. Eleven of the nests were depreciated, nine by pine martens Martes martes and two by unknown predators. One nest was abandoned. Based upon unadjusted daily predation rates, predators destroyed 65% of nests (57% known to be by pine martens) or, after adjusting for the potential effect of the video system, 39% of nests (33% known to be by pine martens). A better understanding of factors affecting pine marten (a protected species in the UK) numbers and hunting patterns is required before a habitat management plan can be implemented to reduce pine marten predation on capercaillie nests.

AB  - Since 1959, the U.S. Congress has legislated the treatment and management of wild horses (Equus ferus caballus) and burros (E. asinus; WHB). While the legislation has ensured WHB a place as western rangeland icons, subsequent congressional actions, in response to public lobbying, have limited federal managers' ability to manage WHB populations under the U.S. public land multiple-use doctrine. Federal land managers tasked with managing for multiple and competing interests on public lands of the western United States must not only consider WHB habitat requirements, but also wildlife species diversity and livestock grazing. Developing multiple-use management strategies while fulfilling other mandates will require balancing rather than maximizing a single resource use or user. Grazing by wild and domestic animals can modify plant community composition and structure, and overabundant populations negatively impact rangeland-watershed function and wildlife habitats. Negative effects on wildlife may include avoidance of water sources by wildlife, forage loss and altered plant communities, altered bird communities, and impacts to soils and insects. Effective management for riparian and rangeland health includes managing both the abundance and the distribution of large grazers. Unless large grazers (including WHB) are managed, range condition and wildlife habitat are at risk. While livestock can be moved and removed, and big game can be hunted, the management and removal of WHB populations continues to face strong public opposition. The management of WHB under the federal land multiple-use doctrine will require implementing innovative, diverse, and tough management strategies founded in the biological and social sciences. This special issue of Human-Wildlife Interactions explores these issues in depth. This paper frames the context in which WHB management must be achieved under the U.S. public land multiple-use doctrine.

AB  - Background: The common quail, Coturnix coturnix, is a migratory bird hunted extensively across Europe. To satisfy this hunting interest, thousands of farm-reared birds are restocked every year. However, restocked individuals are not common quail but hybrids with domestic Japanese quail, C. japonica. Interbreeding between restocked and native birds in the wild allows the entry of alien alleles to the native populations, which could lead to the loss of adaptive phenotypes and behaviours, such as migratory drive. Sedentary individuals may face wintering conditions to which they are not adapted, suffering higher mortality. Some individuals have been observed to remain in northern latitudes during winter.        Question: Does game restocking contribute to the sedentarization of the common quail population?        Method: We sampled 42 quail during the autumn migration and 50 quail during winter in Spain. We genetically analysed them using a set of autosomal microsatellites and also sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We evaluated the proportion of admixed quail found and compared it with that previously found in a breeding population.        Results: None of the migratory quail were admixed individuals, although two of them showed introgression of Japanese mitochondrial DNA. Among wintering quail, only three individuals had a genetic composition compatible with a farm origin, while the rest were common quail. Thus, the proportion of admixed quail during winter was not higher than during the breeding season.        Conclusion: Restocking individuals with domestic Japanese quail ancestry is not directly associated with the presence of quail during winter in northern latitudes. The almost complete absence of individuals of farm origin among the migratory and wintering quail populations indicates that the vast majority of the restocked individuals probably die soon after release. However, the genetic composition of the breeding population has already shown that some survive until the next breeding season and introgress their genes into the wild population.

AB  - Context. The negative effects of agricultural intensification and policies, use of pesticides, fertilisers and mechanised harvesting on several populations of pseudo-steppe birds have increasingly required more detailed and effective habitat suitability models. Distribution models of farmland species are prone to incur recordings of false absence data. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) allows identification of environmental predictors of species distribution by using presence data only.        Aims. We quantified the diurnal habitat preferences and niche width of one steppe species, the stone curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), with unfavourable conservations status in a Mediterranean area and reclassified a map with respect to habitat suitability classes according to the resulting distribution model.        Methods. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used with GIS cartography customised with habitat and anthropogenic variables recorded during field surveys carried out in four study plots (similar to 500 ha) and at different spatial scales.        Key results. The stone curlew selected areas with low vegetation cover, such as fields following artichoke harvesting and tillage, close to rural buildings and unpaved roads. In contrast, the stone curlew avoided areas with high vegetation cover and areas highly disturbed by human-induced fires. The occurrence of natural vegetation was neither preferred nor avoided. The most robust model was based on a large-scale analysis (200 m from the bird location points), according to which the optimal area for stone curlew distribution during its breeding season was restricted to 1% of the entire study area.        Conclusions. Two uncorrelated factors, 'marginality' and 'tolerance', described the stone curlew's niche in the area. The first index indicated selection for habitats that were marginal with respect to those available in the area, whereas the second indicated a species with a medium-wide environmental niche. In particular, the stone curlew occupied a much more restricted niche (low tolerance) in relation to individual variables. The use of customised databases at a large scale of analysis was found to more effectively reveal ecological requirements of this marginal and specialised species.        Implications. Our results allowed us to indicate practical land management actions for the stone curlew, such as prevention of human-induced fires and increase of pastoral activities. Our results indicated a potentially positive role of little-disturbed service roads along rural buildings in stone curlew distribution, which warrants further research. In addition, studies are needed to verify the presence of an ecological trap in artichoke fields, their preferred habitat. As we showed for the stone curlew, niche analyses conducted at a large scale using customised databases could greatly improve habitat suitability models of farmland species.

AB  - Sea urchin harvesting has rapidly expanded in the last decades. Since many sea urchin species play important ecological role, large-scale commercial sea urchin fisheries can have complex effects on benthic communities. In many temperate regions, overharvesting has compromised marine ecosystems to such an extent that reintroduction of sea urchins raised in captivity may be a valid solution for the enhancement of depleted marine wild populations. In some regions of the Mediterranean Sea, improving the growth efficiency of captive sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus to be reintroduced has become a widespread practice. However, no study has yet considered the potential behavioural effects of raising sea urchins in captivity when they are introduced in the natural environment. This study provides information about the behavioural effects of captivity on P. lividus in terms of locomotion performance, a trait that can be fundamental for responding to predators and for relocation after environmental disturbances such as currents and waves. Movements of captive-born and wild sea urchins were video-recorded and compared in (i) total exposure to external cues, (ii) partial exposure to external cues and (iii) absence of external cues. Latency of locomotion, average speed and average velocity of sea urchins showed significant differences with respect to the level of exposure and their origin (i.e. wild vs. captive-born). Our results demonstrate that captive-born sea urchins in the wild showed long latency and slower locomotor performance when compared to wild sea urchins. Conversely, the straightness-of-path and locomotion direction of captive-born and wild sea urchins were similar in natural settings. Our results therefore suggest that captive-born sea urchins suffer the negative effects of captivity when introduced in a natural environment. Understanding the factors that decrease the performance of sea urchin will be important for developing procedures aimed at minimizing the negative effect of captivity before release into the wild.

AB  - Global policy for future biodiversity conservation is ultimately implemented at landscape and local scales. In parallel, green infrastructure planning needs to account for socioeconomic dynamics at national and global scales. Progress towards policy goals must, in turn, be evaluated at the landscape scale. Evaluation tools are often environmental quality indicators. How developments of different organism groups will relate to developments of these indicators is unclear. We evaluated three management scenarios for a 100,000 hectare boreal forest landscape in the coming 100 years in terms of their effects on the future habitat suitability/occupancy of four bird species, six wood-decaying fungi and one lichen, most of them red-listed. The scenarios optimize financial returns and account for downscaled projected global demand of wood given a middle-of-the road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2). We contrast a reference scenario meeting the wood demand against an economy scenario with no upper harvest limit, and a green infrastructure scenario optimizing the levels of environmental indicators. Environmental indicators generally reached the highest and lowest levels in the green infrastructure and economy scenarios, respectively. Most indicators increased further in set-asides. The profit was 14% lower in the green infrastructure and 2% higher in the economy than in the reference scenario. In the green infrastructure scenario, the species increased on average by 135%, followed by the reference scenario (+65%), and the economy scenario (+47%). All bird species increased in the green infrastructure scenario, while in the other scenarios, only hazel grouse increased and Siberian tit instead decreased. Most fungi increased in the production forest of the green infrastructure scenario but decreased in the economy scenario. All increased in set-asides. In all scenarios, the lichen Lobaria pulmonaria increased, owing to host tree retention. Synthesis and applications. Effects of global socioeconomic developments can be downscaled and accounted for in planning landscape-scale forest and conservation management. Accounting for indicators of environmental quality identified forest management scenarios for reaching targets on both revenue and conservation. Rebuilding green infrastructure in the production forest was possible at a relatively minor economic cost and to the benefit of species of conservation concern.

AB  - Several federal agencies are reclaiming land through remediation and restoration, and are considering potential future land uses that are compatible with current land uses and local needs. Understanding potential recreational and wild game consumption patterns and risk perceptions are critical for determining cleanup levels and assessing potential risk associated with certain uses. In this article, recreational rates of people attending the Lewiston "Roundup" rodeo in northwestern Idaho were examined, as well as their perceptions of the safety of consuming fish and game from two Department of Energy (DOE) facilities: the Hanford Site and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental laboratory (INEEL). These are two of DOE's largest sites. Lewiston is closer to Hanford but is in the same state as INEEL. Men engaged in significantly higher hunting and fishing rates than women, but there were no gender differences in camping and hiking rates. Rates of hunting and camping decreased significantly with age, while rates of hiking were lowest for 31- to 45-yr-olds. Level of education generally was not related to rates of recreation. Over 70% of the subjects are deer, elk, and self-caught fish; 30-50% ate grouse, moose, and waterfowl; and fewer people ate other game species. Overall, subjects were less concerned about earing the fish and game from INEEL than from Hanford and more people thought Hanford should be cleaned up completely compared to INEEL. Mean rates of fishing hiking, and camping all exceeded the DOE's maximum recreational exposure assumption of 14 d/yr used in their future use documents. Although at present people are generally not allowed access to DOE lands for recreation, recreation is one future land use being considered for these federal facilities. Given that some people would engage in multiple activities, the potential exists for people living in the general region of Hanford and INEEL to exceed the 14-d exposure assumption. The relative gender differences in recreational rater mean that men are potentially more at risk, particularly since hunting (on both sites) and fishing (on Hanford) are attractive.

AB  - We conducted a questionnaire survey to document the patterns of bird hunting among the Nyishi, Apatani and Monpa tribes of Western Arunachal Pradesh, India. A total of 157 hunters representing 57 % Nyishis, 20 % Monpas and 23 % Apatanis were interviewed to ascertain the seasonality of hunting and number of bird species hunted. Fifty three species of birds including 18 belonging to Schedule I of India's Wildlife (Protection) Act were hunted by the interviewees. Examples of Schedule I species hunted in the region are hornbills, eagles and owls. Passeriformes were hunted most (40 %) followed by Ciconiformes (19 %) and Strigiformes (9 %). These families constituted 70 % of the total species hunted. Hornbills and Galliformes are the most threatened groups in the region. Hunting is intensive during jhum cultivation and harvesting of the crops. However, hunting time and season vary with the species. The average rate of hunting from all major tribal groups is 6 birds hunter(-1) year(-1). The rate of loss from the study area is 10,956 birds year(-1). The implications of the hunting on biodiversity are discussed.

AB  - Different studies have evidenced the relationship between host abundance and health status of wildlife populations. Diseases that benefit from wildlife overabundance can affect not only the fitness and trophy quality of game species, but also public health, livestock health, and the conservation of endangered species. This paper reviews a number of European examples to highlight the relationship between overabundance and disease in game species, and discusses the possibilities of limiting the associated risks. Management tools to estimate overabundance are needed for legislative purposes and for the monitoring of wildlife populations, but artificial feeding interferes in the objective measurement of overabundance. Therefore, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose if a given wildlife population is overabundant. This includes not only signs such as adverse effects on the soil, vegetation or fauna (first group), poor body condition scores, low trophy scores or low reproductive performance (second group), or increased parasite burdens (third group), but also the measurement of infectious disease prevalences (the fourth group of overabundance signs). This combined assessment of overabundance ideally requires the cooperation of wildlife managers, botanists, and veterinarians. Once a given wildlife population is defined as overabundant, it is difficult to establish palliative management actions. These can consist in banning certain management tools (e.g. feeding) or increasing the hunting harvest, but both of them are difficult to implement in practice. A close monitoring of both wildlife densities and wildlife diseases, the establishment of reference values for all signs of overabundance, and the mapping of the disease and density hotspots will be needed to design adequate risk-control measures for each particular situation.

AB  - Four species of the avian family Cracidae were studied in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in north-eastern Peru. These large-bodied birds are an important source of protein for local communities on the periphery of the reserve. An estimated 425 kg of Cracidae biomass were harvested over a I-year period by three communities. Pipile cumanensis was the most frequently hunted bird, both in terms of individuals hunted and biomass extracted. Mitu tuberosa and Penelope jaquacu also made up a substantial amount of the biomass extracted, but were hunted less frequently. Densities of all species of Cracidae within 5 km of the villages were substantially lower than in the interior of the reserve. Our results suggest that M. tuberosa and P. cumanensis are overharvested and P. jaquacu and Ortalis guttata are harvested within the maximum estimated sustainable levels. In this study hunting grounds were along waterways and adjacent to protected populations, which created a source-sink arrangement. If sink areas are overhunted, the unhunted populations inland of the waterways could be acting as source populations that replenish overhunted areas.

AB  - The maleo Macrocephalon maleo (Megapodiidae; Galliformes) is a megapode, endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia, that lays its eggs communally in geothermally or solar-heated soil. The majority of maleo nesting grounds are threatened to some degree and over one-third of known sites have been abandoned. Maleos are severely threatened by habitat degradation and uncontrolled egg-collecting. Hunting of adult birds is also contributing to their decline in some areas. Conservation measures implemented so far have not been sufficiently effective in preventing maleo population declines. In order to safeguard the maleo from further declines we recommend that the laws protecting the maleo and its habitat be strengthened as a matter of urgency and that long-term community conservation and environmental awareness projects be implemented. To achieve these goals we advocate the formation of a collaborative network of international NGOs, Indonesian conservationists, government departments and local communities.

AB  - The critically endangered Double-spurred Francolin (Francolinus bicalcaratus ayesha) is endemic to Morocco, where it inhabits cork oak forests. Its populations have been reduced chiefly due to hunting and habitat destruction. Characterizing the habitat use of native-bred birds is a tool which can optimize recovery programs. Auditory detection was used during transect surveys of calling males to locate breeding birds. We analysed factors determining the occurrence of native Double-spurred Francolins in North-western Morocco using a set of 13 environmental variables. Predictors were aggregated using PCAs and related to species presence/random data using GLMs. The best-supported model of the species' occurrence included three PCA axes and was clearly better (AIC weight = 0.75) than other models. Francolins showed a preference for large trees with low density, and a proximity to cereal fields. This suggests a trade-off between the need to forage efficiently and that to avoid predators. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of the effects of ecological factors on nest habitat selection, productivity and survival of Double-spurred Francolin.

AB  - Hunting activities are responsible for the translocation and restocking of millions of animals throughout Europe, including the introduction of alien species. In a context of the growing use of game translocations and of increasing concern about the impact of biological invasions, our goal is to review the role of alien species introduced primarily for hunting purposes on the European scale. In particular, we explore: (1) the relative importance of game species in the context of alien species introductions; (2) the temporal evolution of the number of species introduced for hunting purposes; (3) the contribution of different taxa; (4) the pattern of introduced game species composition across countries (in terms of similarity), and (5) the underlying human demographic factors driving the diversity of introduced game species per country. According to our results, 24.3% of the mammals and 30.2% of the birds introduced into Europe during the last century were released primarily for hunting purposes, in total, 93 species (63 birds and 36 mammals), the most important taxa being Artiodactyls, Anseriformes and Galliformes. The species composition differed among countries, with a higher diversity of introduced game species in larger countries and in those with a higher human population density and proportion of hunters. This review stresses that hunting was a significant pathway for the introduction of invasive species into Europe in the last century. Since some of the game species introduced have had severe environmental impacts on many European regions, and introductions of non-native game species are still occurring, it is essential to improve regulations and increase public awareness regarding invasive game animals. This will help to preserve biodiversity and improve the sustainability of current hunting schemes in increasingly managed European ecosystems.

AB  - The green peafowl Pavo muticus is a highly threatened galliform species that was historically distributed widely across South-east Asia. Evidence shows a recent population decline and range contraction for this species, linked with habitat degradation and over-exploitation. This study aimed to determine the current known distribution across mainland South-east Asia and investigate potential habitat that could host remaining viable populations and contribute to the long-term survival of the species. We used locations from historical and recent records and habitat variables from a geographical information system database to model the probability of occurrence and classify key localities according to their relative importance for the species. Our results showed that the green peafowl probably occurs in less than 16% of its historical range across mainland South-east Asia and that remaining locations are fragmented. Four confirmed and two potential stronghold populations were identified for the species, based on the localities with high capacity to contribute to its long-term survival in large contiguous patches. These were in central Myanmar, western and northern Thailand, eastern Cambodia/south-central Viet Nam and northern Cambodia/southern Lao. Threats vary amongst countries, with continued habitat loss and degradation in many areas and hunting particularly acute in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao. Most of the remaining populations are in protected areas but the protection level varies widely. We propose conservation actions for each stronghold population, in accordance with the nature of the threats and protection level in each area, to prevent the local extinction of this species.

AB  - Wild birds are intrinsically associated with our perception of the Middle Ages. They often feature in heraldic designs, paintings, and books of hours; few human activities typify the medieval period better than falconry. Prominent in medieval iconography, wild birds feature less frequently in written sources (as they were rarely the subject of trade transactions or legal documents) but they can be abundant in archaeological sites. In this paper we highlight the nature of wild bird exploitation in Italian medieval societies, ranging from their role as food items to their status and symbolic importance. A survey of 13 Italian medieval sites corresponding to 19 'period sites', dated from the fifth to the fifteenth centuries, reveals the occurrence of more than 100 species (certainly an under-estimate of the actual number). Anseriformes and Columbiformes played a prominent role in the mid- and late medieval Italian diet, though Passeriformes and wild Galliformes were also important. In the late Middle Ages, there is an increase in species diversity and in the role of hunting as an important marker of social status.

AB  - Ecotourism is often suggested as a tool for promoting conservation but evidence for its usefulness is mixed. The success of conservation projects is Widely recognized to depend upon the positive attitudes of local communities and thus it is important to know if ecotourism affects local perceptions of natural resources and conservation, as these can be important determinants of conservation behaviour. Rapid Rural Appraisal and questionnaire-based interviews were used to investigate this issue in the village of Grande Riviere, Trinidad. This has a community-based ecotourism programme for leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea, and is also one of the few sites where the Critically Endangered endemic Trinidad piping-guan Pipilepipile maybe sighted. Topics addressed were knowledge and awareness of local conservation issues, focusing on attitudes to the environment in general, turtles and the Trinidad piping-guan. Ecotourism significantly affected perceptions. Villagers showed more awareness and support for turtle conservation than for the piping-guan or any other wildlife. Moreover, those households directly benefiting from the ecotourism industry had better knowledge of local natural resources and greater general awareness of conservation issues (not limited to turtles). Other socio-economic factors such as education and income also affected attitudes and knowledge but the ecotourism effect was still present after accounting for these. Hunting was seen as the main threat to wildlife but was also a popular pastime, illustrating the potential for mismatch between attitudes and conservation behaviours.

AB  - Birds (Class Aves) are already an important source of food in most parts of the world. Only a few species have been successfully domesticated but many others are harvested from the wild. There is potential for greater use of birds as a food source. Existing domesticated species, especially galliforms, need to be better utilized. Certain 'new' species could be brought into domestication. The efficiency and sustainability of harvesting methods for free-living birds might be improved and the harvesting of new species should be considered. These measures could be compatible with improved conservation of wild birds and their habitats, but careful planning and surveillance are essential prerequisites.

AB  - Restocking with non-native species for hunting purposes is a widespread practice in some Galliformes species that may result in the introgression of maladaptive alleles into native populations. Quails farmed for restocking are produced by interbreeding domestic Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) with European quails (Coturnix coturnix). Massive releases of these animals could represent a threat to native European quails. In this study we radio-track 16 female native European quails and 51 female farm-reared quails over four breeding seasons in a single locality. Our results show that farmed female quails attracted more wild common quail males than European quail females, probably because they produce more rally calls. Here for the first time we show empirical evidence that European quails and restocked farmed quails interbreed in the wild. Further, hybrid farmed females and European females had similar probabilities of mating, nesting success, clutch size, fertility, hatching probability and chicks' survival probability. However, female farmed quail had higher mortality than European quail females, and their nests had a higher rate of predation. These last observations could explain why the two lineages do not appear completely admixed after more than 20 years of massive restocking practices. However, our results clearly show a lack of reproductive barriers in the wild and that introgression may not be completely prevented. An immediate ban of the release of non-native quails is necessary to preserve their genetic integrity. Thus, banning restocking with Japanese quail or hybrids is necessary to prevent the progressive introduction of maladaptive alleles into the European quail populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The reproductive biology of Crax globulosa is virtually unknown, this knowledge comprised of only a few anecdotal notes. We found nine nests of Crax globulosa in the middle section of the Jurua River, western Brazilian Amazon, during the dry season. Nests averaged 22.5 m from water and 13.3 m above the ground. We observed two nest types: five made of twigs, leaves and vines, and four within a bromeliad. All nests contained two eggs, but six (67%) were subsequently predated. A female tagged with a transmitter nested twice during the same breeding season. A chick was monitored together with its parents for > 10 months. In addition to hunting and habitat loss, nest predation could be another threat to this endangered species.

AB  - The Mount Cameroon Francolin ( Pternistis camerunensis) is a globally threatened and range restricted bird, which faces natural and human pressures that may alter its distribution and negatively affect its population size. However, the effects of potential human pressures on the species are poorly understood and there is a lack of basic knowledge on its ecology and distribution, hampering conservation efforts. We investigated the effect of environmental variables (vegetation structure, altitude, dry/wet season, tree cover and loss, abundance of key tree species, human threats) on the occurrence and group size of the Mount Cameroon Francolin in the study area. During July 2016, July 2021, February 2022, and July 2022, we established 240 census points along the middle elevations of Mount Cameroon (800-2500 m a.s.l.) where Francolins are reported. At each point, we conducted a bird census using playback within a radius of 300 m, while we visually assessed vegetation structure within a radius of 50 m around each point. We found that the presence of Francolins significantly increased with increasing abundance of African Cherry ( Prunus africana) and decreased with its absence. Secondly, we found that the presence of human threats significantly decreased the percent occupancy by Francolins. Thirdly, Francolin presence was more often during the dry season compared to the wet season. Similar results were obtained when we tested the effect of environmental variables on Francolin group size. Using only the 2022 dataset, we found that Francolin presence and group size were higher at higher elevations, mostly between 1800 and 2200 m a.s.l. This seems to be a habitat optimum for Francolins and based on our data, we estimated its population size there to be 2614 individuals. Group size was further negatively affected by the presence of hunting traps, with Francolins absent from sites where traps were present.

AB  - The helmeted guinea fowl Numida meleagris belongs to the order Galliformes. Its natural range includes a large part of sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal to Eritrea and from Chad to South Africa. Archaeozoological and artistic evidence suggest domestication of this species may have occurred about 2,000 years BP in Mali and Sudan primarily as a food resource, although villagers also benefit from its capacity to give loud alarm calls in case of danger, of its ability to consume parasites such as ticks and to hunt snakes, thus suggesting its domestication may have resulted from a commensal association process. Today, it is still farmed in Africa, mainly as a traditional village poultry, and is also bred more intensively in other countries, mainly France and Italy. The lack of available molecular genetic markers has limited the genetic studies conducted to date on guinea fowl. We present here a first-generation whole-genome sequence draft assembly used as a reference for a study by a Pool-seq approach of wild and domestic populations from Europe and Africa. We show that the domestic populations share a higher genetic similarity between each other than they do to wild populations living in the same geographical area. Several genomic regions showing selection signatures putatively related to domestication or importation to Europe were detected, containing candidate genes, most notably EDNRB2, possibly explaining losses in plumage coloration phenotypes in domesticated populations.

AB  - The extent to which a relationship existed between selected environmental and population parameters and annual production in a population of spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis franklinii) was investigated through correlation analysis of data spanning 16 years. Production of young grouse varied between 0.0 and 1.4 young, aged 4 or more weeks, per resident female over the period of this study. There was no evidence that differences in annual productivity were related to variation (maximum of 17 days) in the onset of reproduction, a function of spring temperatures. Nevertheless, weather conditions during incubation and the immediate posthatch period did exhibit a significant correlation with productivity: cold, wet conditions during incubation were associated with years of poor productivity, whereas the same conditions during the immediate posthatch period were associated with years of good survival of young (at least to 19 days of age). Clutch and brood sizes of yearlings were smaller than those of adult...

AB  - Estimates of spring populations of ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) on a 4-square-mile area (Main Area) near Rochester, Alberta, increased from 112 grouse in 1966 to 124 in 1967 and to 164 in 1968. Data from smaller study areas and provincewide questionnaires showed similar trends. In 1966 and 1967, grouse populations declined rapidly throughout November, but numbers were stationary between December and the following spring. Approximately 36, 42, and 23 percent of the males present in 1966-68 did not establish territories. The numbers of grouse produced (308 and 330) were similar in 1966 and 1967, and survival of juveniles ( 12 months of age). Predation on grouse, mainly by great horned owls (Bubo ?irginianus), lynxes (Lynx canaderesis), and goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) accounted for more than 25 percent of the annual mortality and for more than 80 percent of fall-to-spring mortality each year. In the fall, predation was selective toward males and young but not toward smaller versus larger grouse. As populations of snowshoe hares (Lepus amertcanus) increased rapidly between 1966 and 1969, great horned owls consumed relatively more snowshoe hares and relatively fewer ruffed grouse. It was this shift in predator food habits that allowed higher survival of young ruffed grouse and was thus responsible for increased numbers of grouse in the spring. Marshall and Gullion 1963, Gullion and Marshall 1968, and others ) have implicated predation as an important proximate source of mortality, but the limiting or regulatory effects of predation on these grouse populations were not clear. In western Canada, where the 10-yearcycle is best known and most pronounced ( Keith 1963), little is known of population dynamics of ruffed grouse and the role of predation in the grouse cycle. IThis paper documents the dynamics of an increasing ruffed grouse population at Rochester, A1berta, during 196S68 and quantifies and evaluates the impact of predation upon numbers of ruffed grouse.

Cameron for field assistance and thank 803 Islany past studies of ruffed grouse were concerned with periodic or cyclic fluctuations in numbers, and hypotheses concerning these fluctuations are legion (Keith 1963). Two long-term population studies, the ruffed grouse investigation in New York ( Bump et al. 1947 ) and the Minnesota studies at Cloquet (King 1937, Eng 1959, 1 This paper is a contribution of the Department of Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin, and the Research Council of Alberta.

These cover types are largely self-descriptive, but plant communities and history of recent fires on the Main Area are also described in detail by Rusch et al. 1971. A 330x 660-fo+at grid was surveyed and marked on this area, and the grid intersections served as reference points for locations of traps and grouse. Drumming males were trapped on four smaller areas in the springs of 1966-68. The Landing-trail ( 69 acres ), Moores-pinewoods ( 85 acres ), and Halls ( 63 acres ) areas (Fig. 1), also used as study plots for snowshoe hares, are described by Meslow and Keith (1968:813). Upland forest, the primary grouse habitat near Rochester ( Rusch and Keith 1971), covered all of the Landing-trail and Moores-pinewoods areas, and about 40 percent of the Halls Area. The Camp Area (Fig. 1) consisted of 37 acres of mature aspen woods on a northfacing slope of the Tawatinaw River Valley. This area had probably not been burned for 30 years or more, and many aspen, balsam poplar, and scattered white spruce had attained 13 inches or more in diameter. Alder (Alnus crispa and A. rugosa) and willow (Salix spp.) were the dominant shrubs on the Main, Moores-pinewoods, and Halls areas, but beaked hazel (Corylus cornufa) and s askato on ( Ame lanc hi er alnifolia ) were more abundant on the Camp and Landingtrail areas. Drumming males were experimentally removed from Schmidts Area in 1967 and Revols Area in 1968 ( Fig. 1). These areas consisted of 640 acres and 634 acres of predominantly aspen woods. Both were Oll west-facing slopes of the Tawatinaw River Valley, and both had vegetation similar to that on the Camp Area. 9tG STRE M 2 -n g ---O D

AB  - The density of male blue grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) on a 95-ha area was reduced artificially by approximately 75% in 1982. Density, movements, and breeding success of females on this area in that year were compared with those of females on the same area in 1981 (when density of males was undisturbed) and of females on an unmanipulated control area in 1981 and 1982. A reduction in male density had no apparent effect on the density of either yearling (potential recruits) or adult females, or the daily movements, timing of breeding, and breeding success of females. Home ranges of females were largest when male density was artificially reduced, but not significantly so. The larger home range sizes of females residing in an area with a very low density of males did not seem to result entirely from females searching for males with which to breed. Results of this study suggest that densities of male blue grouse have no apparent effect on densities of females or production of young, and support the hypothesis ...

AB  - Parallel studies on increasing (Zwickel 1972) and decreasing (Bendell et al. 1972) populations of Blue Grouse (Dendragapus obscurus fuliginosus) on Vancouver Island, British Columbia demonstrated that large numbers of yearlings of both sexes were available in spring for breeding in areas that had been largely depleted of residents the previous year. Replacement of former residents was mainly by yearlings, indicating that yearlings, not adults, were the individuals recruited in spring. These data suggest that a "surplus" of yearlings exists in spring and that these birds are excluded by residents. The fate of surplus birds is not known, nor are the factors determining which birds eventually enter the breeding population. When only yearlings were removed from an experimental area on Vancouver Island, 1974 through 1976, more were collected than were identified on a nearby control area (Zwickel, unpubl. data). This experiment again demonstrated the presence of surplus yearlings available for breeding if others were removed. Thus, collections from 1974 through 1976 should contain both "surplus" (potentially non-breeding) and resident (potentially breeding) birds. If individuals in these two groups are identified, comparisons can be made which may indicate the factors important in determining which individuals enter the breeding population. Using material collected from 1974 through 1976, we found that surplus and resident yearling females did exist. We compared these groups to answer the following questions. Are surplus birds excluded before peak breeding begins, as suggested by Bendell et al. (1972) and Zwickel (1972)? Are birds that are present on breeding areas early in the season more likely to breed than those arriving later? Do surplus birds weigh less than breeders?

AB  - The characteristics of the fall phase of dispersal for 41 female and 88 male juvenile spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis) were analyzed for data collected between 1965 and 1984 in southwestern Alberta. Females moved significantly farther than males. Reasons for this difference were sought in location of wintering areas, timing of brood breakup relative to that of brood hen migration, and distance moved by the migrating brood hen. Wintering areas, encompassing blocks of forest within which more than 80% of adults passed the winter, represented less than 15% of the study area. These areas were apparently also the destination for a high proportion (84%) of the juveniles. Distances moved are believed to be influenced by the location of the wintering areas in relation to the direction taken by juveniles after brood breakup occurs, as well as the timing of this event in relation to the timing of migration in adult hens. Brood breakup of juvenile males preceded that of females (median 4 and 15 September, resp...

AB  - Dispersal and autumn to spring mortality of juvenile spruce grouse (Canachites canadensis franklinii) were studied in southwest Alberta in 1970-73. Changes in breeding population size primarily resulted from changes in numbers of yearlings recruited. Dispersal in autumn did not change the size or sex ratio of the juvenile cohort. The reduction in total juveniles during autumn and winter averaged 12%. Survival over winter for all age and sex classes averaged 88%. Ninety percent of the loss of juveniles during autumn through spring was attributed to emigration. Among spring emigrants, known survival into summer was at least 64% and survival for 1 year was at least 54%. Dispersal in spring was more variable than in autumn and was important for changing numbers of potential recruits. Density did not appear to affect the magnitude of dispersal. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 43(3):717-727 Among Tetraonidae, losses of young during autumn and winter presumably are most responsible for changes in size of the breeding population (Boag 1966; Bendell and Elliott 1967; Zwickel and Bendell 1967a; Rusch and Keith 1971; Bendell 1972a,b; Weeden and Theberge 1972). However, there has been some recent modification of that conclusion. Bendell et al. (1972) and Zwickel (1972) emphasized the importance of behavioral interaction in early spring to recruitment of new birds. With few exceptions (Watson 1965, Jenkins et al., 1967, Rusch and Keith 1971) little has been done to study losses of birds in autumn and winter and the effect of those losses on recruitment (Bendell 1972b). The objectives of my study were to monitor changes in numbers of juvenile spruce grouse caused by dispersal and mortality from autumn through spring, and to evaluate impact of the changes on recruitment into a breeding population. Franklin's spruce grouse were chosen for study because McCourt (1969) and McLachlin (1970) indicated that they could be captured and observed easily, and that turnover rates were low. Spruce grouse were suspected to be less migratory than some other tetraonids, thus facilitating year-round work at a single site. I express thanks to D. A. Boag and F. C. Zwickel, University of Alberta, for their interest and stimulation, for their many arguments about interpretations, and for their reviews of early drafts of the manuscript. I thank the following students for field assistance in summer: the late W. Etherington, A. Garbutt, M. Henderson, R. Salter, K. Smith, and D. Thompson. STUDY AREA AND METHODS The study area of 5.2 km2 at an elevation of 1,500-2,000 m was adjacent to Gorge Creek (50'39'N, 114'39'W), near the R. B. Miller Biological Station, 27 km west of Turner Valley, Alberta. About 70% of the area was dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), 25-35 years 1 Financial support was provided by Postgraduate Scholarships from the National Research Council of Canada (1971-74), a Conservation Education Grant (1972-73) from the National Wildlife Federation, and the University of Alberta. D. A. Boag, University of Alberta, provided funds for equipment and assistants through a N.R.C. Operating Grant.

Small patches of mature white spruce (Picea glauca), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) occurred on the area. Most understory tree growth was white spruce, with alder (Alnus crispa) and willow (Salix spp.) as common shrubs. Grouse occupied immediately contiguous forest on half of the perimeter of the study area. Grouse were located with pointing dogs and censused repeatedly by searching subsections of the study area on a rotation basis during a continuous 40month period between May 1970 and September 1973. Grouse were captured with an extendable snare pole (Zwickel and Bendell 1967b) and were marked with individual color combinations of leg bands. Sex and age of grouse over 40 days old were determined from plumage (Zwickel and Martinsen 1967, Ellison 1968). The classification for age was: juvenile, from hatch in year x to 1 April of x + 1; yearling, to 1 April of x + 2; adult, after 1 April of x + 2. April 1 was the dividing date because it approximated breakup of winter flocks and beginning of dispersal. The breeding population was the adult and yearling grouse on the study area between 15 May and 15 August. This interval excluded migrants. Courtship occurred before 15 May but nearly all breeding occurred after that date. Yearlings present by 15 May were considered recruited because they were present during primary breeding activity and likely were an important component in the social system even if they did not mate. Autumn was from 1 September to the start of winter. Winter started with permanent snow cover, beginning 10 November 1970, 17 December 1971, and 1 December 1972. Winter ended 31 March, approximately at the beginning of loss of snow cover. Spring refers to 1 April to 15 May. Dispersal is normally considered as movement from birth to 1st breeding site (Dice and Howard 1951, Haukioja 1971). In this study, movement to potential breeding sites occurred in autumn or spring; some juveniles moved at both times, others only once, and others not at all. For juveniles moving in both seasons the autumn move to a winter site was considered to be a part of their total dispersal movement because most habitat used in winter was potential breeding habitat. Juveniles that moved from brood range or winter range without leaving the study area are, herein, not termed dispersers. The dispersal process was measured numerically as the net of numbers of emigrants and immigrants. Most emigrants moved far enough that they had little or no contact with remaining residents during the breeding period. Therefore, emigration was distinct from local

AB  - One hundred seven adult and yearling blue grouse (DendragaptAs obscurus) of both sexes were shot from an area of 900 acres near Middle Quinsam Lake, Vancouver Island, in the spring of 1970. The area was virtually emptied. In 1971, about 90 percent of the population on the removal area was replaced, mostly by yearling males and females, in an equal sex ratio. The control population was essentially unchanged in density, sex ratio, and age structure. The ingress of yearlings did not reduce the number of yearlings in the breeding populations on the control and surrounding areas. The main conclusion is that established or resident adult and yearling grouse interacted with yearlings to regulate yearling recruitment, and, in turn, to regulate the level of the breeding population. This interaction apparently happened in the early spring and on the summer range. Yearlings not recruited to the breeding population were surplus and disappeared. This process of population regulation occurred in the sparse and declining population at Middle Quinsam Lake and in a nearby dense and expanding population. It also operated in the sparse and declining population when this population was dense and stable. Hence, the process seems general in blue grouse, and perhaps also in other animal populations. Within broad limits, ^ve cannot correlate the ordinary variables of the environment, including the quality of food, with the regulatory process and the density of breeding grouse. The behavior of grouse in relation to each other and the causes of this behavior may be most relevant to population regulation and density. Future work should concentrate on when, how, and why some yearlings become established in the breeding population while others are excluded. parently occurs in early spring. Residents are adult and yearling breeding males and females and recruited yearling males (Bendell and Elliott 1987). Adults are approximately 2 years of age and older; yearlings are approximately 1 year old. They can be separated by features of plumage and weight (Bendell 1955a, Boag 1965).

AB  - Two hypotheses are evaluated to explain the annual changes in the size of breeding populations of ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.) from one breeding season to the next: H1, fluctuations are caused by density-dependent changes in the mortality of birds 4 months old and older that are excluded by territorial behaviour; and H2, populations fluctuate through annual changes in breeding success during the previous season. In 11 populations reviewed here, changes in the size of breeding populations were positively correlated with the previous season's breeding success. Significant mortality in three populations of birds > 4 months of age occurred during the winter before the birds became spaced on territories in the spring. In 9 of the 11 ptarmigan studies reviewed, sizes of spring populations were linearly correlated with the size of the fall populations the previous year, indicating that little compensatory, density-dependent mortality between the breeding seasons, a test implication of the territorial hypothesis (H1)...

AB  - Male red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus (Lath.)) contest for territory each autumn, and some males are successful while others fail to secure territories. This paper describes experiments undertaken to test whether males which were not occupying territories could become territorial if the established territory owners were removed; that is to say, whether the number of breeding males was being limited simply by the territorial accommodation available or by some deficiency in the unsuccessful birds. Previous research consisted of counts of the grouse on 100-120 ha study areas on heather (Calluna vulgaris L. (Hull)) moorland in north-east Scotland, with more detailed studies of the behaviour of individually marked birds on smaller parts of these areas (Jenkins, Watson & Miller 1963, 1967). Territorial behaviour, courtship and pair formation are described by Watson & Jenkins (1964). The population studies showed that there were many more grouse in autumn, even after the grouse shooting was over, than in the following spring. The behaviour studies showed that grouse populations from October to May consisted of (a) cocks which courted hens and defended territories, plus hens paired with them (territorial birds), and (b) non-territorial birds which did not defend territories, show courtship, pair up, or breed. Classes (a) and (b) both included birds less than 1 year old (called 'young' in this paper) and older birds. On average, 52%0 of the August population later became non-territorial over the autumn and winter and died before the next April-May (Jenkins et al. 1967), whereas both young and old territorial grouse survived the winter well and bred next summer. Consequently we postulated (Jenkins et al. 1967) that possession of territory was essential for breeding, and that territorial behaviour in autumn greatly limited the size of the next spring's breeding stock. These hypotheses were open to the criticism that although territorial behaviour was associated with the population changes, it might not really be preventing the non-territorial grouse from taking territories. The crux was to find if they would take territories and breed when vacant ground was made available. If they did not, the hypotheses would be refuted. One might then explain the presence of non-territorial birds simply by suggesting that they were immature individuals, as in many other species where some individuals do not breed till 2 years old or more.

AB  - We studied a population of spruce grouse in southwestern Alberta over a period of 10 years. During this time the density of birds in the spring population varied between 10.5 and 19.3 per 100 ha. Changes in density appeared to reflect changes in rates of recruitment to the spring population more than changes in rates of mortality among the members of the established population. Recruitment of yearlings was influenced by the density of adults at the onset of the breeding season as was the number of young surviving to independence. We postulate that these two relationships prevent spring densities varying greatly from year to year: spacing behaviour of adults appears to regulate the spring density of grouse locally by forcing yearlings, in excess of those required to fill vacancies, to disperse; the density of grouse during the breeding season appears to influence inversely the number of juveniles surviving to September and consequently the number of yearlings locally available the following spring.

AB  - In a 6 yr study of Willow Grouse diet, Vaccinium species dominated crop contents in autumn, together with Eriophorum species in spring. During winter, a diet dominated by shoots and catkins from mountain birch Betula pubescens var. tortuosa was eaten. In vitro digestibility, protein and ash levels of crop contents were 24-34% lower, while fibre content was 20% higher in winter than in the other seasons. Marked annual variation in the yield of mountain birch shoots and catkins were registered. The yield of shoots showed a gradual 4-yr increase followed by a marked decline in the following year. The percentage of different birch parts in late winter crop contents, and their chemical composition, varied significantly between years. Annual variation in winter diet composition as well as the fat level of grouse were to a large extent related to food abundance. Multiple regression equations showed that 92-96% of the observed variability in grouse fat levels was accounted for by the yield of mountain birch shoots and catkins. In spring, large annual variation in species composition of the food was related to variation in the in vitro digestibility. This food quality parameter was positively correlated with the size of the fat reserves of breeding females, which in turn was related to breeding success, indicating that maternal nutrition affects Willow Grouse reproduction. However, the two worst grouse breeding years were associated with declines in the populations of small mammals, so that predator "switching" may have contributed to the low grouse reproductive success. On the other hand, nutrition alone may have been responsible for the synchrony.

AB  - We report a distribution-free approach to the detection of density-depen- dence in the variation of population abundance, measured by a series of annual censuses. The method uses the correlation coefficient between the observed population changes and population size and proposes a randomization procedure to define a rejection region for the hypothesis of density-independence. It is shown that the use of the proposed statistic under the randomization approach is equivalent to the likelihood ratio test for a particular family of time series models. The randomization test is compared with two other recently proposed tests. Using computer-generated density-independent and density-dependent data, it is shown that, unlike the other tests, the randomization test is effective whether or not there is a marked trend in the observed data. Arguments are presented showing how one of the other two tests can be further improved. Caution is urged in the use and interpretation of any test for detecting density-depen- dence in census data because (a) the tests depend on assumptions about population pro- cesses, (b) errors of measurement may lead to spurious detection of density-dependence.

AB  - During a 7-year study of greater prairie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) in Kansas, 24 juveniles were captured, banded, and fitted with radio transmitters. Their monthly ranges and day-today movements showed that they moved more than adults during late autumn and during the spring booming season. They also suffered heavier morta ity than adults, especially during the fall dispersal. Broods broke up before dispersing, and both activities occurred in late August through September. Mortality was about 56 percent for broods under 10 weeks of age, and less thereafter. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 41(1):27-34 Although biologists investigated brood activities of some grouse species in North America, few data are available for greater prairie chickens. Earlier studies of prairie chickens in Kansas (Robel et al. 1970) detected extensive movements of juveniles in October and November. If the increased movements represented dispersal, and the observed high mortality of these dispersing juveniles was representative of all juveniles, then dispersal and resulting mortality might be a force regulating the population. The primary objective of this study was to gather additional information on mobility, mortality, brood break-up, and dispersal of juvenile greater prairie chickens. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation of J. Simpson, owner of the land on which this study was conducted, and the field assistance of J. Tatschl, A. Bisset, and D. Bowen. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was done in Geary and Waubaunsee counties, 20 to 30 km southsoutheast of Manhattan, Kansas, in 1964-70. The area is typical of the western edge of Kansas Flint Hills bluestem prairie, which extends from Nebraska southward to Oklahoma. The topography and vegetation of the study area were described by Robel et al. (1970). Year-round grazing by cows with calves was light to moderate with some season-long grazing by steers and rotation of pasture use. Some of the pastureland was mowed annually for prairie hay. Juvenile prairie chickens were livetrapped on booming grounds in spring and fall with cannon nets (Silvy and Robel 1967) and throughout the year with funnel-type, walkin traps of various sizes (Watt 1969:34). All caught were banded, and some were equipped with miniature radio transmitters (Marshall and Kupa 1963, Brander 1968) and released. Their subsequent movements were monitored with portable receivers. When a bird with a transmitter moved beyond the range of ground-based portable receivers (0.8 to 1.5 km), portable receivers in a Cessna 120 aircraft were used. At an altitude of 300 m, signals could be received from 13 km. When a bird could not be located after 2 days of ground and aerial searches, its transmitter was assumed to have stopped working. Attempts were made to locate each transmitter-equipped prairie chicken two or three 1 Contribution No. 1266, Division of Biology, Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.

Occasional continuous monitoring for 10to 24-hour periods supplemented the data on daily movements. Radio-determined locations were plotted on base maps and the outermost points connected to determine monthly ranges for each bird (Mohr 1947). The distances between successive daily locations gave an index of mobility. On any day when two or more locations were recorded for an individual bird, we chose one of them at random to represent that day. Ranges and distances for each juvenile were calculated for each month, movements from the last day of one month to first of the next being recorded in the earlier month. Standard errors were calculated (Snedecor and Cochran 1967:50) for both ranges and distance for each month class. The distance between capture site and the last location was the "effective distance of dispersal" (Johnston 1961).

AB  - (1) The breeding success of female red grouse treated with an anthelmintic to reduce an infection of the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis was compared over a period of 3 years with that of a control group. Treatment significantly increased the production of young per female in all years. (2) Breeding success showed a significant, negative correlation with parasite numbers in old grouse, both within and between areas (in 4 out of 5 years). (3) The role of parasitic nematodes in the population cycles of red grouse are discussed in relation to current models and previous studies.

AB  - During a nine-year study of Capercaillie almost twice as many female as male chicks were reared, but there were no more hens than cocks in the adult population. Both the proportion of male chicks in late summer each year, and mean brood size, were related to the chicks' condition in July. Condition was related to the number of days with rain in early June, during and just after hatching. The breeding density of hens each year varied between 4.0 and 8.0 km-2 but was related neither to their density in the previous year nor to the production of female chicks in the intervening summer. The best predictive model was simply that breeding densities would return to their mean each year. It was inferred that breeding densities were determined by densitydependent losses and gains involving emigration and immigration. Autumn densities of young and old birds were not related to breeding densities and breeding success, but were inversely related to the proportion of broods which disappeared, and probably emigrated, during the summer.

AB  - The number of chicks reared by Capercaillie was inversely related to the number of days with rain during and just after their hatching. However, rain had no detectable effect on the breeding success of Black Grouse on the same study area. The breeding distribution of Capercaillie in Scotland is more limited than that of Black Grouse, which extends into rainier areas. It is speculated that sexual selection for large size in Capercaillie has indirectly caused their chicks to be more vulnerable to rain and, consequently, has limited their distribution to less rainy areas.

AB  - Analyses are given for several parameters in the production of juvenile spruce grouse in a local population in southwest Alberta (Canachites canadensis franklinii), 1970–1975, and in northeast New Brunswick (C. c. canace), 1975–1980. Canachites c. canace exhibited greater clutch size, nest success, proportion of females with broods and production of juveniles. Hatchability of eggs, average brood sizes, and mortality rates of juveniles were similar. Differential nest success appeared to be a primary influence on the difference in production of juveniles. In autumn, canace exhibited a substantial net reduction in juveniles as a consequence of dispersal, but not franklinii. Densities of juveniles in winter were similar. Speculation is provided about the differences in production and their association with other aspects of life history, notably the quality of juvenile stock.

AB  - A population model for bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) was used to evaluate harvest strategies via simulation. Highest sustained yields were obtained from a simulated annual harvest rate of 55%, which reduced standing fall densities by 28%. A harvest regime of 40-45% (including crippling loss) seemed most appropriate as nearly comparable returns were realized with considerably less population reduction. Compensatory adjustments to exploitation were afforded by the nonadditive numerical relationship between hunting and nonhunting losses plus the density-dependent nature of seasonal mortality and reproductive rates. These mechanisms interacted to cushion, but not completely absorb, the impact of hunting on standing densities. Successful population adjustment to exploitation became progressively more difficult as harvesting intensified because the rate of recruitment necessary to maintain equilibrium increased exponentially with increased fall to spring mortality. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 43(2):285-305 Despite the bobwhite's widespread popularity as a game bird, the effects of varying intensities of harvest on standing densities and long-term yields are not well documented. There is not a consensus optimum harvest rate nor criteria for defining one. Some apparently consider it virtually impossible to overshoot quail under natural conditions (discussions following Mosby and Overton 1950:353355, and Swank and Gallizioli 1954:296297)-a view not shared by Errington and Hamerstrom (1936:422). Recommended harvest rates in the literature range from under 40 to 70% of fall densities (Errington and Hamerstrom 1935, 1936:423, Baumgartner 1944:259, Rosene 1969:206207, Vance and Ellis 1972:169). Hickey (1955a:374) reasoned that monogamous birds could probably tolerate a hunting kill equivalent to about 1/2 of their annual

AB  - In their review, Bergerud et al. (Bergerud, A. T., Mossop, D. H., and Myrberget, S. 1985. Can. J. Zool. 63: 2240–2248) evaluated two hypotheses to explain changes between years in the number of breeding ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.): "(i) numbers are limited by territorial spacing behaviour (Watson and Moss 1972) [Watson, A., and Moss, R. 1972. Proc. Int. Ornithol. Congr. 15: 134–1491 and (ii) numbers change in response to annual variations in breeding success." Several of the general definitions or views that they proposed are theoretically unsound or ambiguous, and certain specific statements inaccurate. After stating that "the primary implication of the breeding success hypothesis, namely that chick survival to autumn will be reflected in the next year's population, is not a mutually exclusive test" and after giving no mutually exclusive test themselves, they went on to use the invalid test of a correlation between changes in numbers and breeding success as if it were mutually exclusive. The reviewers' conc...

AB  - An experiment in which yearlings of both sexes of blue grouse (Dendragapus obscurus fuliginosus) were removed from breeding range showed that about two times, or more, yearlings of each sex were identified here as compared with a nearby control area, though numbers of "surplus" yearlings varied among years. The removal of large numbers of yearlings from the experimental area did not reduce breeding density, except ephemerally in 1 year. Nor did the removal of these birds affect populations in the surrounding area. These data confirm results from earlier studies with blue grouse, that surplus yearlings of both sexes are present on the breeding range. Replacement yearlings of both sexes (those taking the place of birds removed) were able to breed, but those removed sequentially (1974 to 1976) were lighter in body weight than those captured on control areas or those that settled synchronously after a near-total removal experiment in the same area. I infer from these results that some form of behaviour keeps ...

AB  - The number of spruce grouse (Falcipennis (Canachites) franklinii) present in the spring population on a 247-ha block of pine-dominated habitat in southwestern Alberta was counted annually over a 21-year period. During the first 5 years of this study, the population increased steadily from 7.3 to 16.6 grouse/100 ha. Subsequently, for a period of 11 years, numbers were relatively stable at higher densities (19.0–29.1 grouse/100 ha). During the last 5-year period, the population declined to levels lower than at the onset of the study (16.6–4.9 grouse/100 ha). Year to year fluctuations in the size of this population were considered in the light of two hypotheses put forward to explain such fluctuations (spacing behaviour and breeding success). We concluded that both hypotheses were needed to explain our observations. During those years when spring population size fell below the mean number of grouse recorded over the 21-year period (17.8/100 ha), there was some evidence that breeding success in one year may h...

AB  - TFHE Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), normally nesting in remote boreal or montane forest regions, is seldom considered a significant problem in small game management programs. Darrow (in Bump, et al., 1947) considered the Goshawk to be unimportant as a predator upon Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in New York state, stating, (p. 327), "During the winters in which goshawks appeared grouse kills attributable to them were found but the net effect on overwinter loss was not appreciable." Roberts (1936) and Grange (1948) similarly considered the Goshawk unimportant as a threat to small game populations because of its seasonal and/or sporadic appearance in areas where this species' depredations come into conflict with man's interests. However, Edminster (1947:197) lists the Goshawk as a grouse predator of "primary importance" in the northeast, and notes (p. 206) "The goshawk is the one species of predator for which ruffed grouse furnishes a really big proportion of the food." He also comments (loc. cit.), "It may be fortunate for grouse that the goshawk is not more generally plentiful." Few reports dealing with the Ruffed Grouse and the factors causing decimation of its populations fail to mention the Goshawk. Fisher (1893), and most subsequent authors discussing the Goshawk (including McAtee, 1935; Roberts, op. cit.; Bent, 1937; and Mendall, 1944) agree that the largest of the so-called "bird hawks" is bold and rapacious. Fisher (op. cit.:45) comments, "In some parts of the country the Goshawk hunts the ruffed grouse so persistently that it is known by the name of 'Partridge Hawk', and this bird probably has no worse enemy except man." Nearly every report on the food habits of Goshawks lists a high incidence of small game species, particularly Ruffed Grouse, in the diet. Latham (1950) lists Ruffed Grouse as being one of the most frequent prey of Goshawks in the northeastern United States. In a listing (p. 8-9) of the contents of 1,105 Goshawk stomachs, Ruffed Grouse remains occurred in 255 instances (23 per cent of the stomachs). Only domestic poultry (with 301 occurrences) exceeded Ruffed Grouse in the sample. On the other hand Meng (1959) found remains of only five Ruffed Grouse among 185 prey items brought to 14 Goshawk nests studied in New York and Pennsylvania. During the course of five years (1956-1961) of Ruffed Grouse investiga-
