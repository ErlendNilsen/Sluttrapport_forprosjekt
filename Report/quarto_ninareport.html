<section id="inl" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Sustainable harvest management of our game resources is a key goal in Norwegian nature management. In order to achieve sustainable management, it is generally recommended to an adaptive approach, where one actively searches for new knowledge that is necessary to fill existing knowledge gaps <span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson1997">(<a href="#ref-Johnson1997" role="doc-biblioref">Johnson et al. 1997</a>)</span>. In recent years, however, people have become more aware of the partly enormous changes we face in the coming years, which are expected to largely affect hunting management. These challenges are largely linked to climate change and other (man-made) changes in the natural environment, but also changes in other components of the socio-ecological systems wildlife species are part of are expected to influence how sustainable management is defined <span class="citation" data-cites="Bowler2020 Eriksen2018 Henden2020 Mansson2023">(<a href="#ref-Eriksen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Eriksen et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-Bowler2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bowler et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-Henden2020" role="doc-biblioref">Henden et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-Mansson2023" role="doc-biblioref">Månsson et al. 2023</a>)</span>. With increased focus in society on the loss of biological diversity on a global and national scale, one can further expect increased expectations in society that recreational hunting is carried out in a sustainable way with little risk of overharvesting. This will lead to stricter requirements for documentation of sustainability and data bases will increase. More recent conceptual studies of adaptive management have discussed how such new “settings” not only force new knowledge needs, but that it can also lead to changed objectives and measurement parameters for adaptive management <span class="citation" data-cites="Mansson2023">(<a href="#ref-Mansson2023" role="doc-biblioref">Månsson et al. 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A central concept for predicting the effect of hunting on wildlife populations is the relationship between additive hunting mortality (which comes in addition to other mortality) vs compensatory hunting mortality (which is compensated by other mortality being reduced in proportion to the harvest mortality - see <span class="citation" data-cites="Perone2013">Péron (<a href="#ref-Perone2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Sandercock2011">Sandercock et al. (<a href="#ref-Sandercock2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>). Our knowledge of this comes largely from experimental studies carried out at the end of the 1990s under the auspices of the “Rypejaktprosjektet” (with Hans Chr. Pedersen, NINA, as project leader). Here it was concluded that hunting mortality was partially compensatory at low harvest rates, while it was additive or even super-additive at high harvest rates <span class="citation" data-cites="Sandercock2011 Pedersen2004">(<a href="#ref-Pedersen2004" role="doc-biblioref">Pedersen et al. 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-Sandercock2011" role="doc-biblioref">Sandercock et al. 2011</a>)</span>. This knowledge base was produced by carrying out large-scale experimental studies, where the hunting harvest (respectively 0, 15 and 30%) was distributed randomly between the study areas. Effects were investigated both directly in terms of survival (using radio-tagged birds - see <span class="citation" data-cites="Sandercock2011">Sandercock et al. (<a href="#ref-Sandercock2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>) and indirectly via population densities (see <span class="citation" data-cites="Pedersen2004">Pedersen et al. (<a href="#ref-Pedersen2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>). This project focused exclusively on willow ptarmigan (<em>Lagopus lagopus</em>), and no similar knowledge exist for black grouse <em>(Lyrurus tetrix</em>) and capercaillie (<em>Tetrao urogallus</em>).</p>
<p>Whether results from the former large scale experiement is transferable in time (i.e.&nbsp;to the current environmental conditions) and to other species (i.e.&nbsp;black grouse and capercaillie) is an empirical question that cannot be answered by directly by existing data. For example, one can expect that climate change will have significant effects on the trophic interactions that largely affect grouse population dynamics and densities <span class="citation" data-cites="Bowler2020">Henden et al. (<a href="#ref-Henden2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Changes in these interactions will have the potential to directly affect grouse populations’ potential to compensate for hunting mortality (see discussions in e.g. <span class="citation" data-cites="Perone2013">Péron (<a href="#ref-Perone2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>). Similarly, large changes in the size of the grouse population could have similar effects, since the degree of compensation can be closely linked to density dependence <span class="citation" data-cites="Sinclair1996">(<a href="#ref-Sinclair1996" role="doc-biblioref">Sinclair and Pech 1996</a>)</span>. One way to address these uncertainties would be to conduct an conceptual replication of the well-known experiments carried out in the 90-ties. Such conceptual replication studies (<em>sensu</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Nakagawa2015">Nakagawa and Parker (<a href="#ref-Nakagawa2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>) are rare in ecology <span class="citation" data-cites="Fraser2020">(<a href="#ref-Fraser2020" role="doc-biblioref">Fraser et al. 2020</a>)</span>, but have recently been strongly recommended to examine the validity and generalizability of previously conducted studies <span class="citation" data-cites="Fraser2020 Nakagawa2015">(<a href="#ref-Nakagawa2015" role="doc-biblioref">Nakagawa and Parker 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-Fraser2020" role="doc-biblioref">Fraser et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, before such a replication is carried out it is a prerequisite that an up-to-date mapping of the research-based literature on the sustainable management of galliformes from a climate change perspective is conducted (see also <span class="citation" data-cites="Grainger2020">Grainger et al. (<a href="#ref-Grainger2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>), to ensure that the replication rests on the best available knowledge. In addition, a thorough planning of how best to design such in a way that both sample sizes and climatic gradients are sufficient to close the most pressing knowledge gaps. This report is a part of the planning stage of such a project, where the intent is to apply experimental harvest treatment to populations of willow grouse, black grouse and capercaillie in Norway. It includes two main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A systematic mapping of the literature related to effects of harvest on galliformes</p></li>
<li><p>A thorough evaluation of the experimental design including both the sampling of study subjects and assignment of treatment levels.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will first present the results from the systematic mapping of the literature, and then the evaluation of experimental design. In the final chapter, we will present a detailed description of the suggested design for the new harvest experiment.</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Systematic mapping of the literature</h1>
<p>This systematic map is produced as part of the preparation of a large-scale harvest experiment in Norway outlined above. We aimed to identify studies that have quantitatively assessed the effects of legal harvest (i.e.&nbsp;managed hunting) on Galliformes to ensure that the planned experimental studies on the sustainability of galliform hunting are based on the best available evidence. This mapping aims to identify, categorise, and synthesise existing research on how hunting mortality interacts with ecological and environmental factors. By systematically compiling relevant studies, we provide a foundation for assessing knowledge gaps and determining the generalisability of past research.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://osf.io/ny2jt/">protocol</a> was prepared prior to conducting the search. Here, we include the relevant information and report any deviation from the protocol.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="search-for-articles"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Search for articles&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We used a PIO (Population, Intervention, Outcome) question structure to help develop the search strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Population (P): Bird species within the order Galliformes&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention (I): Legal (managed) hunting or harvest&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Outcome (O): The&nbsp;ecological impacts of (managed) hunting on population dynamics, demography, genetics or behaviours &nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We searched for academic literature (publications) in two search platforms; Web of Science and lens.org. Specifically, we searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WOS.SCI: 1987 to 2025, WOS.AHCI: 1987 to 2025, WOS.ESCI: 2020 to 2025 and WOS.SSCI: 1987 to 2025) using the NINA library subscription and the following search string:&nbsp;</p>
<p>((TS=(galliform* OR grouse OR ptarmigan OR Phasianidae OR pheasant OR “lagopus lagopus” OR “lagopus muta” OR “wild turkey” OR “bobwhite” OR partridge))&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND (TS=(“hunt” OR “harvest”)))&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND SU=(“Ecology” OR “Wildlife” OR “Environment”)&nbsp;</p>
<p>For lens.org we used the following search string:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(abstract:(“galliform” OR “grouse” OR “ptarmigan” OR “Phasianidae” OR “pheasant” OR “lagopus lagopus” OR “lagopus mura” OR “wild turkey” OR “bobwhite” OR “partridge”) OR title:(“galliform” OR “grouse” OR “ptarmigan” OR “Phasianidae” OR “pheasant” OR “lagopus lagopus” OR “lagopus muta” OR “wild turkey” OR “bobwhite” OR “partridge”)) AND abstract:(“hunt” OR “harvest”) OR title:(“hunt” OR “harvest”) AND field_of_study:(“Ecology” OR “Wildlife” OR “Environment”)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a backward and forward citation chasing (using CitationChaser) was performed based on the three first benchmark papers listed below <span class="citation" data-cites="Sandercock2011 Pedersen2004 Sedinger2005">(<a href="#ref-Pedersen2004" role="doc-biblioref">Pedersen et al. 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-Sedinger2005" role="doc-biblioref">Sedinger and Rotella 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-Sandercock2011" role="doc-biblioref">Sandercock et al. 2011</a>)</span>. &nbsp;</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benchmark-papers"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Benchmark papers&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The following benchmark papers was used to assess the effectiveness of the search string. We expected to find all these papers in a review of this question. We recorded if each benchmark paper is found in the searches (WoS and lens.org).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We reviewed scientific articles from all parts of the world. We included papers covering all galliform species. Studies of both native and introduced populations were eligible. Studies of all spatial scales and across all relevant ecosystems were considered eligible. Only studies documenting the effects of legal and/or managed harvest on galliform populations were eligible. Studies of poaching were not eligible. The effects must be assessed quantitatively for the study to be eligible. Eligible outcomes included effects of harvest on population abundance, density, sex- and age structure, recruitment, survival, behaviour, genetics, physiology and distribution. Studies focusing on lead (or heavy metal) poisoning or content in wild birds from shooting were not eligible. Both observational and experimental study designs are eligible. Mathematical simulation studies are eligible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

There were 9 conflicts (where reviewers disagreed on eligibility). All these papers were taken through to the fulltext stage and assessed for eligibility. Exclusion decisions (650 records) were due to the research not focusing on the effects of legal or managed hunting (365 records), not being focused on Galliformes (276 records), not quantitative (23 records), abstract not found online (16 records), or abstract not available in English, Norwegian, Swedish or Danish (3 records).</p>
<p>At the fulltext stage 90 articles were excluded (3 with no available pdf, 6 not focused on Galliformes, 12 not assessing the effects of hunting quantitatively and the rest, 61, not documenting the effects of legal harvest). This left 129 papers that went forward to the data extraction stage.</p>

<p>Legal hunting of Galliformes has been the subject to extensive research. In our searches we identified studies published as far back as 1963, but we are aware that research on this topic was carried out even before that, however these studies were not covered by our searches. The number of studies per year peaked in 2020 (8 studies per year) and the long-term average was 2.93 studies per year (<a href="#fig-Publication_year" class="quarto-xref">Figur&nbsp;2</a>).</p>

<p>Most studies covered in our mapping were observational (106 studies), but there were also a substantial number of studies that relied on simulations or scenario analysis (35 records; <a href="#fig-Research_design" class="quarto-xref">Figur&nbsp;5</a> a)). Note that the sum of observational studies based on empirical data and studies based on simulations is higher than the total of 129 papers that were found eligible. This is because some studies used both research approaches and thus were included in both categories. In agreement with previous assessments of study designs in ecological research (refs) most of the studies that presented empirical data were based on simple (and less robust) study designs (<a href="#fig-Research_design" class="quarto-xref">Figur&nbsp;5</a> b)). There were only 6 papers using a “Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)” approach, the study design that leads to the highest level of evidence for causal understanding <span class="citation" data-cites="christie2019simple">(<a href="#ref-christie2019simple" role="doc-biblioref">Christie et al. 2019</a>)</span> and these were limited to Norway (5) and the USA (1).

<p>We also extracted information about to which extent harvest rates (or percentage of the population removed by harvest) were reported in 71 papers. The remaining papers did not explicitly report such information (<a href="#fig-Harvest_rateAdditive" class="quarto-xref">Figur&nbsp;6</a> a)). Moreover, among the papers that reported harvest rate or harvest mortality, only 27 made any assessment to which extent harvest was additive or not (<a href="#fig-Harvest_rateAdditive" class="quarto-xref">Figur&nbsp;6</a> b)). Note however that this is somewhat ambiguous, and it might depend on how the concept of additivity is defined: although we did not quantify this by direct coding we note that much fewer studies were in fact able to properly document additivity vs compensation via a robust quantitative approach (see also discussion in ref).</p>

<p>From each of the eligible studies we assessed which outcome variables were examined (<a href="#fig-EBV_name2" class="quarto-xref">Figur&nbsp;7</a>), at two different levels (EBV class and EBV names, respectively). In general, there were about equal number of studies focusing on “Species traits” (67 records) and “Species populations” (60 records). Note that we did not record this variable for simulation based studies. Separating the EBV classes into EBV names, we found that the most commonly studies outcome variable was “Survival” (67 records), followed by “Population density/abundance/growth*” (47 records). In addition, several studies focused on effects of “Movement rates” or “Habitat use/selection” (12 and 6 records, respectively), and 11 papers reported effects of harvest on “Sex- and age-structure”.</p>

<p>Among studies that were based on (mathematical or statistical) simulations, the most common approach was to compare different harvest strategies (22 records), followed by conducting population viability analysis (17 records) and various forms of sensitivity analysis (13 records). In total, 11 studies were aiming to estimate/calculate maximum sustainable yield. Note that many studies used several of these approaches, so that the combined numbers will be higher than the total of 35 papers that included simulations or scenario analysis.</p>

<p>Overall, there has been a substantial amount of research on the effects of harvest on galliform species. However, our mapping of the literature also revealed that the literature is dominated by non-experimental research and often conducted at a local or regional scale. We identified only two research projects that were based on a RCT approach, of which one of the projects (represented with five papers) were the former Norwegian project on willow ptarmigan carried out in the late 1990s. Moreover, while the willow ptarmigan (or willow grouse) is well represented in the literature (28 records), there was little research on capercaillie (4 records) and black grouse (6 records), and no experimental assessment of the effects of harvest were identified.</p>

<section id="experimental-design" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Experimental design</h1>
<p>The planned harvest experiment will rely on the existing line transect surveys gathered through Hønsefuglportalen (Ref). In cooperation with Statskog and selected “Fjellstyrer” in Norway, the planned experiment will have access to a range of hunting areas from mid- and northern-Norway covering a latitudinal gradient between approx. 58 <!-- (if Njardarheim is included) --> and 69 degrees. <!--# More here -->.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will provide the basis for the experimental study design for the planned hunting experiment. We will start by defining some key terms (<strong>BOX: Glossary of terms</strong>), and then put this into the context of the planned experiment. First we will define the harvest treatment in terms of harvest levels. Then, we will present the results from a simulation exercise that was conducted to assess the required sample sizes. Then, we will present a detailed description of how study areas (study units) were “recruited” based on a pre-determined set of criteria. Finally, a complete list of study units will be presented together with key characteristics and the randomly allocated harvest treatments.</p>
<p>The setup of the experiment must be carefully designed such that the potential effects of both climate and harvest on ptarmigan and forest grouse populations will be detectable in the study. This means that the experimental design must include 1) areas with enough climatic variation and 2) large enough samples, i.e., number of areas, to statistically estimate the effects of the treatments (harvest rate) and covariates (climatic variables) on survival and population growth rate. Here, we have done a power analysis using simulations, with reported values of survival and population density from the literature, to estimate the number of areas needed to get the statistical power to test the effects of experimental treatments and climate.</p>

<p><strong>General terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcome variable:</strong> This is the variable of interest, the one to draw inference about. Defining the outcome is part of the planning of an experiment. In our harvest experiment, the outcome variables of interest include the effects of experimental harvest on i) survival and ii) population growth. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Study population</strong>: The population we will draw inference about. In strict terms, this is the willow ptarmigan population within the geographical boundaries of our study. Assuming that the willow ptarmigan population in our study area respond in a similar way to harvest mortality as other populations, we can make predictions about how the response will be in other areas. By including <em>covariates</em> that affect the outcome (response to harvest) these predictions could be made more accurate and less biased.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical population</strong>: A statistical population is the set of subjects that we sample from and make inference from. In our case, the statistical population is the harvest areas that are included within the study area. One subject in the statistical population from which we draw some measurement is typically named a statistical unit or a sampling unit.</p>
<p><strong>Sampling frame:</strong> The sampling frame is the “collection” of all study subjects that are available for inclusion / sampling. A structured way of thinking about this is to think of a regular grid covering the whole study area. However, in our case the grid is not regular but consists of harvest areas of different sizes. In addition, we will have to make other adjustments to the sampling frame: i) only areas with “sufficient” line transect survey data are available for inclusion, and ii) only areas larger than a cut-off size. These adjustments and their consequences should be considered before we make the final decision, as they can induce bias (see below). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blocked study design</strong>: In blocked designs, the study units are grouped (blocked) by some characteristics. In a <u><em>randomized block design</em></u>, the treatment level is randomly assigned within the blocks. A block design typically means that the sample size must be larger in order to obtain the same statistical power as in non-blocked designs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Internal and external validity</strong>: The term <u><em>internal validity</em></u> refers to which extent the inference drawn from the sample, e.g.&nbsp;in terms of cause-effect relationships are true for the sample itself. The term external validity relates to which extent one can generalize from the current sample to the larger population that we usually want to make statements about. While the former in large-part is determined by the robustness of the methods and how treatment levels are assigned etc, the latter is in large-part determined by the sampling design and to which extent the included units are representative for the population. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recruitment/inclusion of study subjects</strong></p>
<p>The rules or algorithms chosen when recruiting / including study subjects. Since we cannot usually measure all subjects in the population, this usually involves some form of probabilistic or non-probabilistic sampling. Should be constructed to minimize the potential for <em>biased</em> estimates of inference. For instance, if all included subjects share a common characteristic that is not shared with other members of the statistical population, then the results might be biased. This is termed selection bias. Selection bias occurs whenever the subjects that are included in the study systematically deviate from the study population. Note that selection bias might also apply when assigning treatment level to a study unit in an experiment (covered below). &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Probabilistic sampling to recruit study subjects:</strong> This involves using recruiting units into the study by some sort of random (probabilistic) sampling. In the basic form (i.e.&nbsp;<u><em>random sampling</em></u>), all units have the same probability of being recruited. In <u><em>stratified random sampling</em></u>, the units are sorted along one or more covariates to ensure all values along the covariate are represented with a certain proportion in the sample. Under proportional stratification, all “strata” are represented with a proportion that is similar to their proportion in the statistical population. Under balanced stratification, the number of recruited units are balanced (e.g.&nbsp;similar) across strata. Under <u><em>restricted random sampling</em></u>, the initial sampling might be random but it is combined with rules that make the next decisions non-probabilistic. Examples include “do not include units that are located next to each other” etc. Another sampling strategy that combines probabilistic and non-probabilistic sampling is <u><em>systematic sampling</em></u> when the selection of the first unit is decided by a random draw.</p>
<p><strong>Non-probabilistic selection to recruit study subjects:</strong> These approaches include methods that use non-probabilistic criteria to select study subjects. Such criteria could include geography, certain characteristics (i.e - placement along a covariate axis but with no random selection – as opposed to stratified random sampling) and expert knowledge. A very specific type of non-probabilistic selection is <u><em>convenience sampling</em></u> where the units that for some reason are “easiest” to include are selected. One method that further resembles “stratified random sampling” is what is often termed <u><em>proportional quota sampling</em></u> in the medical literature. Here, the number of units that are included are proportional to the size of the strata, but the selection of units to include are not done at random. In cases when the total size of the population from which to draw sampling units from is unknown, this method will be known as <u><em>non-proportional quota sampling</em></u>. Finally, <em>purposive sampling</em> is a rather broad class of approaches where each study unit is recruited into the study based on one or more specific characteristics. In strict terms, a non-probabilistic selection of study subjects does not rely on a sampling frame. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assignment of treatment level to each study unit</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In manipulative experiments, there also need to be rules for assigning treatment level to the study subjects. This can be done by <u><em>random assignment</em></u> or non-random (<u><em>quasi random</em></u>) assignment. Under <u><em>random assignment</em></u> of experimental treatment level the treatment level (or control vs treatment) is randomly assigned to each unit. This is efficient in terms of assuring internal validity, as there will be no confounding effects from covariates. In <u><em>blocked designs</em></u>, treatment levels are randomly assigned within blocks. In a <u><em>crossover study</em></u> or trial, each study subject obtains a series of treatments allocated at random. In most cases, the study is designed so that all included subjects receive all treatments in a random order. This will result in a <u><em>balanced study design</em></u>, where the number of observations for each treatment are the same. This is in contrast to parallel studies or non-crossover studies where each unit is exposed to only one treatment level. For heterogeneous samples, one advantage (depending on the analyses methods) is that each study subject can serve as their own control.</p>

<p>In the planned experiment, we will base the harvest treatment for willow ptarmigan on the same experimental levels as the former large-scale experiment carried out in the 1990s in Norway <span class="citation" data-cites="Sandercock2011">(<a href="#ref-Sandercock2011" role="doc-biblioref">Sandercock et al. 2011</a>)</span>: 0%, 15% and 30% harvest, respectively. This will make our results directly comparable to those results. For black grouse and capercaille, we will apply 0%, 10% and 20% harvest. The rationale for this is that these birds have a slower life history and higher natural survival rates, and thus we expect that harvest is additive for these species.</p>

<p>Harvest treatment for each study unit will be randomly allocated based on a crossover study design. As the planned experiment will have three experimental harvest levels (see above) and last for three seasons, one study unit, i.e., one hunting area, will be subject to each harvest treatment. The sequence of the treatments will be randomly decided for each study unit. To ensure a balanced design in terms of the combined allocation of harvest levels across years we will make a balanced set of sequences and randomly allocate a sequence to a study unit. Since there are three harvest treatments there will be six unique sequences of treatments of which each area will be given for the duration of the experiment. For example, if there would be 30 study units included in the experiment, each treatment sequence would be given for <span class="math inline">\(30/6 = 5\)</span> areas.</p>

<p>Based on the distance sampling line transect survey data collected from the study units, we will focus on the effects of harvest on two outcome variables, namely i) (annual) survival probability under different harvest treatments and ii) population growth under different harvest treatments. In addition to including information about harvest treatment, we will include information about climatic and biotic factors (in particular rodent dynamics) known to affect grouse population dynamics or is expected to affect the effect of harvest on the outcome variables of interest.</p>
<p>We will base our inference on the model presented by <span class="citation" data-cites="nilsen2023">Nilsen and Nater (<a href="#ref-nilsen2023" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> to assess effects on survival. This model allow us to directly assess effects of harvest on survival rates, as it includes information about the population structure to estimate survival and recruitment rates separately. In this model, population growth rate is not estimated directly but is a derived parameter; thus we will use a modelling framework similar to that presented in (<span class="citation" data-cites="Bowler2020">Bowler et al.

<p>Each year, prior to the hunting season, a hunting quota that corresponds to the randomly allocated harvest level will be allocated based on the annual line transect surveys. The population density in a given hunting area is estimated using distance sampling techniques (<span class="citation" data-cites="nilsen2023">Nilsen and Nater (<a href="#ref-nilsen2023" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Bowler2020">Bowler et al. (<a href="#ref-Bowler2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). The transect surveys are coordinated through Hønsefuglportalen and the results can be used to estimate the total population density as well as the number of adults and juveniles (that years production of chicks). In most hunting areas the yearly production is an important parameter in setting the yearly quotas, but in the harvest experiment the quotas are based on the total population size. For example, if the harvest level for a given year is 30 % and the density is estimated as 15 birds/km^2 in a area of 100 km^2, that years hunting quota will be <span class="math inline">\(density \cdot area \cdot harvest level = 15 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.3 = 450 birds\)</span>.</p>

<p>The willow ptarmigan populations that will be used in the harvest experiment are all surveyed approximately one month after breeding when the chicks are large enough to take flight. To simulate the effects of harvest and climate on willow ptarmigan survival and population growth rate, we used a post breeding projection matrix (<span class="math inline">\(A_t\)</span>) with two age classes: juveniles (0-1 year) and adults (1+ years):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A_t =
\begin{bmatrix}
f_{juv,t} &amp; f_{ad,t} \\
s_{juv,t} &amp; s_{ad,t}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span> where, <span class="math inline">\(s_{juv,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_{ad,t}\)</span> are age-specific survival rates and <span class="math inline">\(f_{juv,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_{ad,t}\)</span> are recruitment (number of juveniles produced per female) multiplied with age-specific survival. A projection matrix contains both survival and reproduction for a population and can be used to calculate the population size for the next time-step, <em>t + 1</em>, directly from the age-specific population size at the last time step, <em>t</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
N_{t+1} = A_tN_t
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>A</em> is the projection matrix and <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> is a vector containing age-specific populations sizes at time <em>t</em>. In these simulations we assumed equal recruitment for the two age classes. Survival estimates were collected from Sandercock et al., (2011) while recruitment was modelled as a normally distributed variable with an average of two juveniles per female and SD = 0.3. The yearly population growth rate, <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span>, was calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r_t = log(N_{juv, t+1} + N_{ad, t+1}) - log(N_{juv, t} + N_{ad, t})
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(N_{juv}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_{ad}\)</span> is the number of juveniles and adults at time <em>t</em> and <em>t+1</em>. Both survival rates and population sizes were simulated with environmental stochasticity, i.e., year-to-year variation, and observation error to better reflect the «real» parameters that will be collected during the harvest experiment.</p>

<p>To evaluate and analyse the effects of harvest, we assigned the simulated hunting areas with a harvest treatment, i.e., a harvest rate of either 0, 15 % or 30 % each year over the study period of three years. Because we aim to test the effects of all treatments in all areas, the treatments were randomly given to each hunting area without replacement to ensure that each area cannot have the same treatment twice. In addition to harvest treatment, we simulated the effect of a climate covariate directly on survival. The “climatic variable” chosen was latitude and it was simulated with a slope of 0.003. This does not mean that we expect to see any direct effect of latitude in the real experiment, but rather it was included as a proof-of-concept to test the effects of a climatic covariate. To investigate how many areas are needed in the harvest experiment to be able to estimate the effects of both harvest treatments and climate we simulated ptarmigan populations over a range of hunting areas, from 15 to 35. For each number of hunting areas, we did 500 simulations over three years.</p>

<p>The effects of harvest treatment and the climatic variable on survival was modelled using a generalized linear model with a quasibinomial error function. In the simulated harvest experiment, both harvest treatment had a clear effect on survival which was evident for all sample sizes (number of areas) for the 30 % harvest, while the effect of 15 % harvest was found in &gt; 95 % of the simulations from 17 areas and upwards. The effect of the climatic variable was found in &gt; 84 % of the simulations from 20 areas and upwards.</p>
